  abstract = {We present an approach for the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns and scale-dependence in the dynamics of plant communities that combines well-known methods to reduce complexity arising from the high-dimensionality of ecological data. Our approach takes into account both correlations and autocorrelations in the structure and dynamics of the community. In application to a sand dune annual plant community, we find answers to questions regarding the nature of community response in space and time, and identify significant spatiotemporal interactions and spatiotemporal scales. Community-level spatial correlograms reveal a fixed pattern in time that is not apparent from species-level dynamics. In this sense, the community is shown to be more stable than the sum of its parts. This form of stability is not a simple artifact of averaging species-specific responses, and points to some consistency in species interactions. Temporal correlograms are highly spatiallyspecific. In this sense, the inclusion of the spatial information is shown to change our view of temporal dynamics. The relative importance of biological processes versus an environmental gradient is examined in the temporal community response. We find that community response to rainfall is also spatially-specific and that the temporal autocorrelation dynamics shows similar patterns even when the effect of rainfall is removed. Our findings are relevant to both empirical and theoretical work aimed at understanding the interaction between space and time in ecological communities. Nous pr\'esentons une m\'ethode d'analyse des patrons spatiotemporels et de la d\'ependance d'\'echelle dans la dynamique des communaut\'es v\'eg\'etales.

However, it is often difficult to quantify empirically as it requires intensive and detailed field study. Here we describe a method for estimating the effective dispersal distance of tropical plant populations. The method integrates a simple spatially explicit, individual-based dynamic model and spatial statistical analysis. The model is partly parameterized from spatial point pattern data as well as time series data from a 50 ha tropical forest plot in Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama. Correlation between our estimated dispersal distances and those from inverse modeling based on field studies to date on BCI raises some questions about the match between our methods and those previously used. The method we propose can be generalized to any population for which spatial point pattern data are available. Additional field studies would be useful to further validate our method.},

  abstract = {Ecological and environmental monitoring has become increasingly important, with increasing threats from human disturbances. Monitoring usually involves sampling from several sites of a similar habitat at regular (or irregular) intervals through time. The purpose of monitoring is to determine where and when an impact may have occurred or, once detected, may still be occurring. Sequential statistical methods, including control charts, as developed for industrial applications, offer some promise in this regard. These provide a way of identifying when a system (e.g., in a factory) is going ``out of control,'' so as to trigger an alarm to stop the system and employ appropriate remedial measures. Such techniques clearly would be useful in the context of environmental monitoring. Traditional control charts, however, cannot be used for many ecological applications because they do not handle multivariate data, and individual counts of species abundances do not generally fulfill the necessary statistical assumptions. A distance-based multivariate control chart method is described here, with some examples of its use in monitoring coral reef fish assemblages of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The method is flexible, as it can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, and useful, as it does not require any specific assumptions regarding distributions of variables. Bootstrapping techniques are used to provide control-chart limits for an appropriate multivariate distance-based criterion through time. The method is designed to identify impacts at individual sites as quickly as possible, thus triggering an ``alarm bell'' in the context of ecological monitoring. It can also be applied at several spatial scales in hierarchical designs.},

As global ecosystems become increasingly stressed by, for example, climate change, human activities and invasive species, there is an even greater need to learn from the past and to strengthen links between models and palaeoecological data. Using examples from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, we suggest that better interactions between modellers and palaeoecologists can help understand the complexity of past changes. With increased synergy between the two approaches, there will be a better understanding of past and present environmental change and, hence, an improvement in our ability to predict future changes.},

Most multivariate analyses provide ordination diagrams or biplots that are too cluttered to allow simple reading and are unfamiliar to most users. To overcome such difficulties, a novel application of principal response curves (PRCs) is proposed. Principal response curves are traditionally used to assess treatment effects on community structure measured repeatedly over time. In this new application, the tested factor and the repeated-observation axis are replaced by time and space, respectively. The georeferencing of sampling sites permits to produce an easy-to-read map that summarizes both the temporal dynamics of the community and the contribution of each species to these dynamics at each sampling site. A 24-yr-long time series of scientific surveys monitoring 77 fish and cephalopod species in the Eastern English Channel is used to illustrate the novel application of the PRC method. This new application could prove a relevant tool for the ecosystem approach to human activities management by providing spatialized indicators of community changes, as spatial monitoring tools are increasingly recommended for measuring the effectiveness of management actions.},

  abstract = {1. Previous attempts to identify nationally important wetlands for biodiversity in New Zealand were based on expert panel opinions because quantitative approaches were hampered by a lack of data. We apply principles of systematic conservation planning to remote sensing data within a geographical information system (GIS) to identify nationally important palustrine and inland saline wetlands. 2. A catchment-based classification was used to divide New Zealand into 29 biogeographic units. To meet representation goals, all wetland classes need to be protected within each unit. 3. We mapped current and historic wetlands down to a minimum size of 0.5~ha. Over 7000 current wetlands were mapped using standardised satellite imagery and a collection of point or polygon data. Historical extent was estimated from soil information refined using a digital elevation model. The current extent of wetlands is 10\% of the historic extent, which is consistent with previous estimates. 4. A classification was produced using fuzzy expert rules within a GIS to identify seven wetland classes: bog, fen, swamp, marsh, pakihi/gumland, seepage and inland saline. Swamps and pakihi/gumland are the most common, but the former has sustained the greatest reduction in area with only 6\% of its historical extent remaining. A preliminary field assessment of classification accuracy in the Otago region found only 60\% agreement, mainly because of the misclassification of marshes into swamps. 5. Wetland condition was estimated using six measures of human disturbance (natural cover, human-made impervious cover, introduced fish, woody weeds, artificial drainage and nitrate leaching risk) applied at three spatial scales: the wetland's catchment, a 30-m buffer around the wetland and the wetland itself. Measures were transformed and combined into a single condition index. More than 60\% of remaining wetlands had condition indices {$<$}0.5, probably indicating moderate to severe degradation and loss of native biodiversity. 6. Sites were ranked within each biogeographic unit using the wetland classification to ensure a representative set of wetland diversity. Rankings were determined by combining condition and complementarity to calculate conservation effectiveness that was then weighted by irreplaceability. Highest ranked sites in each biogeographic unit were usually the largest remaining wetlands that contained multiple wetland classes. This reflects their potential to protect a diverse range of wetland classes and a high proportion of the remaining habitat.},

  abstract = {Ecological restoration aims to revitalize ecosystem integrity and functionality following severe damage or degradation. Often, however, efforts are hampered by an incomplete or flawed concept of historical `reference' used when choosing or constructing a target ecosystem or landscape to restore `to'. This problem may stem from a culturally-skewed interpretation of history or from misunderstanding or underestimation of the role that humans have played in a given ecosystem's historical development and dynamics. While strongly confirming the importance of the reference concept in restoration ecology, we argue for the need to refine it, and to broaden the ways it can be conceived, developed, and applied. Firstly, the historical reference system informing a given restoration project should be grounded in both latent and active `ecological memories', encoded and stored across relevant geographical and temporal scales. Further, the generally neglected geomorphic component of reference-building should also be addressed, as well as the contributions of human cultures to current ecosystem and landscape condition. Thirdly, ecosystems are historically contingent and multi-layered. Pre- versus post-disturbance comparisons are insufficient. Instead, restoration scenarios should be seen as tapestries of multiple and successive states. In sum, a well-conceived reference model helps promote and ensure the recovery and subsequent maintenance of historical continuity, i.e., the reestablishment of an impaired ecosystem to its historic ecological trajectory. We use case studies from Spain and Peru to illustrate how this approach can provide better goalposts and benchmarks, and therefore better guide the planning, implementation, and evaluation of effective restoration projects.},

The synthesis is drawn from the other articles in this volume, the workshop that initiated them, and the scientific literature. It summarizes the status of our present scientific understanding, discusses means by which to actualize the existing potential for matching the scales of research and regulation with the scales at which effects are observed, and provides guidelines for building a stronger scientific base for landscape-level assessments of cumulative effects. It also provides the outlines for a synoptic and qualitative approach to cumulative effects assessment based on a reexamination of the generic assessment framework we proposed elsewhere in this volume.The primary conclusion to be drawn from the articles and the workshop is that a sound scientific basis for regulation will not come merely from acquiring more information on more variables. It will come from recognizing that a perceptual shift to larger temporal, spatial, and organizational scales is overdue. The shift in scale will dictate different\textemdash not necessarily more\textemdash variables to be measured in future wetland research and considered in wetland regulation.},

In particular, it has been observed that deep-water hypoxia may potentially lead to regime shifts of lake benthic communities. We explored such community shifts by reconstructing a high-resolution subfossil chironomid record from a sediment core collected in the sub-alpine lake Remoray in France. We identified an abrupt shift in chironomid composition triggered by the collapse of the dominant Sergentia coracina-type chironomids around 1980. We found that the collapse of Sergentia coracina type was coupled to a gradual increase in organic matter content in lake sediments caused by eutrophication. We concluded that the most probable cause for the collapse of Sergentia coracina type was a change in oxygen concentrations below the minimal threshold for larval growth. We also analyzed trends in variance and autocorrelation of chironomid dynamics to test whether they can be used as early warnings of the Sergentia collapse. We found that variance rose prior to the collapse, but it was marginally significant (Kendal rank correlation 0.71, p = 0.05), whereas autocorrelation increased but insignificantly and less strongly (Kendal rank correlation 0.23, p = 0.25). By combining reconstructions of ecosystem dynamics and environmental drivers, our approach demonstrates how lake sediments may provide insights into the long-term dynamics of oxygen in lakes and its impact on aquatic fauna.},

However, the effectiveness of restoration actions in increasing provision of both biodiversity and ecosystem services has not been evaluated systematically. A meta-analysis of 89 restoration assessments in a wide range of ecosystem types across the globe indicates that ecological restoration increased provision of biodiversity and ecosystem services by 44 and 25\%, respectively. However, values of both remained lower in restored versus intact reference ecosystems. Increases in biodiversity and ecosystem service measures after restoration were positively correlated. Results indicate that restoration actions focused on enhancing biodiversity should support increased provision of ecosystem services, particularly in tropical terrestrial biomes.

  abstract = {The detection of anthropogenic disturbances requires appropriate sampling design and powerful statistical tests. This study illustrates how simulations of environmental disturbances may be used to improve the capability of any given sampling design to detect impacts of a specified magnitude. Here, real data on the abundance of algae and invertebrates are used to simulate the effects of environmental disturbances on two rocky shores in the northwest Mediterranean. Natural populations were sampled eight times between 1995 and 1996 in mid-shore habitats on each of two shores. Four sites were sampled at each of three different levels on the shore each time. Three replicate quadrats were sampled in each site. This design was rearranged to create two ``Impacted'' and two ``Control'' sites at each level on each shore. The first four times were used as ``Before'' data; the latter four times represented a series of ``After'' data. Two different approaches were used to simulate environmental impacts. The first was based on the methodology developed in the context of Beyond BACI designs, and consisted in altering the mean abundance of organisms of known amounts at the ``Impacted'' sites for the ``After'' series of data. Simulated data were generated by multiplying the real values by random variates obtained from binomial distributions of means 0.8, 0.5, and 0.2, to simulate reductions in mean abundance to 0.8, 0.5, and 0.2, respectively. These data were analyzed using analysis of variance following the logic of Beyond BACI designs. A Monte Carlo procedure was also developed based on the linear model of the Beyond BACI design, using real estimates of spatial and temporal variance of the red alga Rissoella verruculosa. Power of the Before/After vs. Control/Impact (B \texttimes{} I) interaction was calculated from sets of 1000 simulations under the alternative hypothesis of an impact causing a reduction in mean abundance of the alga to 0.5. Power curves were generated for the B \texttimes{} I interaction using different combinations of number of sites, number of times, and number of replicate plots, thereby providing a direct way of optimizing the sampling design. In most cases impacts were detected as significant changes from before to after the simulated disturbances in the differences between the impacted and control sites. The probability of detecting an impact was not consistent between the two shores, and it also changed in relation to level on the shore. Statistical power was large for several of the tests involved in the detection of the simulated impacts. Sample size was also calculated for different combinations of Type I and Type II errors, indicating that the sample size required to design powerful environmental sampling programs can be maintained within a range of acceptable and logistically feasible sampling efforts for these rocky shores. In some cases it was not possible to proceed with calculation of power and sample size using classical procedures based on non-central F distributions, due to the impossibility of providing an error term with a single component of variation. The Monte Carlo procedure developed here solved this problem, providing a tool of potential wide application for the design and optimization of environmental sampling programs.},

  abstract = {Efforts to restore enriched lakes have increased yet there remains uncertainty about whether restoration targets can be achieved and over what timescale. Paleoecological techniques, principally diatom analyses, were used to examine the degree of impact and recovery in 12 European lakes subject to eutrophication and subsequent reduction in nutrient loading. Dissimilarity scores showed that all sites experienced progressive deviation from the reference sample (core bottom) prior to nutrient reduction, and principal curves indicated gradual compositional change with enrichment. When additive models were applied to the latter, the changes were statistically significant in 9 of the 12 sites. Shifts in diatom composition following reduction in nutrient loading were more equivocal, with a reversal towards the reference flora seen only in four of the deep lakes and one of the shallow lakes. Of these, only two were significant (Lake Bled and Mj\o sa). Alternative nutrient sources seem to explain the lack of apparent recovery in the other deep lakes. In three shallow lakes diatom assemblages were replaced by a community associated with lower productivity but not the one seen prior to enrichment. Internal loading and top down control may influence recovery in shallow lakes and climate change may have confounded recovery in several of the study sites. Hence, ecosystem recovery is not simply a reversal of the degradation pathway and may take several decades to complete or, for some lakes, may not take place at all. By assessing ecological change over a decadal to centennial timescale, the study highlights the important role that paleolimnology can play in establishing a benchmark against which managers can evaluate the degree to which their restoration efforts are successful.},

However, there have been few studies of modern pollen\textendash vegetation relationships in these circumstances. Here as an aid to the interpretation of fossil assemblages we determine the distribution of pollen derived from dry land sources within areas of fen carr. In particular, we examine the effect distance from the dry land/fen carr edge has on the pollen representation of the dry land vegetation components. Data on vegetation composition and modern pollen samples (from moss polsters) were collected from a series of sample points within two areas of fen carr and adjacent drier woodlands in Norfolk, UK. The spatial distribution of the pollen derived from dry arboreal elements is explored through trend surfaces and plots of pollen representation against distance away from the dry land/fen carr edge. The pollen assemblages from the fen carr sample points reflect and can be used to infer the composition of adjacent dry woodland areas where they are dominated by the relatively high pollen producers Quercus and Betula. The presence of dry taxa that occur away from the dry land/fen carr edge is difficult to detect even if these taxa are generally regarded as over-represented in the pollen record (e.g. Pinus sylvestris). Arboreal elements that are present in the vegetation close to the edge of the dry land show a general declining trend in pollen representation within the first 80 m of fen carr. Factors influencing this pattern include the variable input of pollen from wetland taxa and the spatial irregularity of the dry land/fen carr edge. Pollen recruitment into fen carr systems resembles other closed canopy sites. Palaeo-sites situated within c. 80 m of the dry land/fen carr edge afford the opportunity to reconstruct vegetation at the stand scale. However, adjustments need to be made for differential pollen dispersal, for example, the local presence of Fraxinus excelsior and Sorbus-type can only be detected within c. 20 m of the dry land edge. The interpretation of pollen sequences must also allow for changes in the position of this edge through time.},

With the shift from description and evaluation in conservation biology in the 1960s\textendash 1990s to the paradigm of `conservation in a rapidly changing world' in the late 1990s, conservationists began to realise the importance of the temporal dimension in developing conservation strategies to allow for landscape and ecosystem change. Despite this paradigm shift, ecological palaeoecology is still largely ignored by conservation biology. I explore why this may be and outline recent advances in the subject of direct relevance to conservation science. I present nine questions of critical importance to conservation that palaeoecology can answer. Inevitably during this honeymoon phase of conservation biology and palaeoecology, there are controversies, challenges, and compromises. I outline these and suggest how some can be overcome by breakdown of the largely artificial boundaries between landscape history, cultural history, conservation, and palaeoecology, and by the appreciation that all can make important contributions to our understanding of people and nature and conservation in the face of changing land-use, environment, and landscapes.},

The maps are presented at 500-year intervals and are based on syntheses of fossil pollen data. Fagus sylvatica replaced deciduous mixtures in southerly regions, and during the last 500 years Picea abies became a widespread dominant. We interpret this transformation as being partially a consequence of the climate-driven, continental-scale migrations of Fagus and Picea, but the major controlling factor appears to have been former land-use. This conclusion has significant consequences for `nature-based' silviculture and conservation of biodiversity. Many threatened species are associated with deciduous forest mixtures, and these forest types have experienced recent, rapid decline. We state that a biologically sustainable silviculture in southern Sweden should be based on a larger range of tree species than at present, thus mimicking natural conditions and providing a greater diversity of product and biological value for the future.},

We show by examples that constrained ordination can yield more informative views on effects of interest compared to unconstrained ordination (where such effects can be invisible) and show how constrained axes can be interpreted. Constrained ordination uses an ANOVA/regression approach to enable the user to focus on particular aspects of species community data, in particular the effects of qualitative and quantitative environmental variables. We close with an analysis examining the interaction effects between two factors, and we demonstrate how principal response curves can help in their visualisation.

The transition from Tilia cordata to Fagus sylvatica dominance in a small forest hollow in Denmark was not predicted by a climate-driven forest simulation model and could be ascribed to anthropogenic impact. This transition can be upscaled to a large region of north-west Europe and contributes to a data-model mismatch for the European distribution of Fagus 6,000 years ago. A data-model mismatch for Picea abies during the last few centuries in southern Scandinavia can also be attributed to anthropogenic impact. Combining pollen data and vegetation models can help with the important task of upscaling from the scale of the forest stand, where anthropogenic impact is readily detectable, to regions and continents, where it is more challenging to distinguish anthropogenic impact from the impacts of climatic change.},

It is possible to obtain such information from fossil pollen records in lakes and bogs using the landscape reconstruction algorithm (LRA) and its two models, REVEALS and LOVE. These models assume that reliable pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) are available for the plant taxa involved in the quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation, and that PPEs are constant through time. This paper presents and discusses the PPEs for 15 tree and 18 herb taxa obtained in nine study areas of Europe. Observed differences in PPEs between regions may be explained by methodological issues and environmental variables, of which climate and related factors such as reproduction strategies and growth forms appear to be the most important. An evaluation of the PPEs at hand so far suggests that they can be used in modelling applications and quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation, provided that consideration of past environmental variability within the region is used to inform selection of PPEs, and bearing in mind that PPEs might have changed through time as a response to climate change. Application of a range of possible PPEs will allow a better evaluation of the results.},

In principle, these processes can be distinguished by determining whether historical changes in focal parameters (phytoplankton) exhibit transient (rising then declining) or continuously-elevated variability characteristic of alternate stable states or a ``paradox of enrichment,'' respectively. We tested this hypothesis in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg, Canada, a site with intense blooms of N2-fixing cyanobacteria since 1990, but for which little is known of earlier limnological conditions, causes of eutrophication, or whether modern conditions represent a alternate stable state. Paleolimnological analysis revealed that the basin was naturally mesotrophic ({$\sim$}15\textendash 20 {$\mu$}g P L-1) with diazotrophic cyanobacteria, productive diatoms, and phosphorus-rich sediments. Eutrophication accelerated during ca.1900\textendash ca.1990, when sedimentary nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon contents increased 10\textendash 50\%, {$\delta$}15N enriched 3\textendash 4\textperthousand, and concentrations of many fossil pigments increased 300\textendash 500\%. Nearly 75\% of 20th century variability was explained by concomitant increases in production of livestock and crops, but not by climate. After ca.1990, the basin exhibited a rapid threefold increase in akinetes from Aphanizomenon and Anabaena spp. and 50\% declines in pigments from chlorophytes and cyanobacteria because of sudden socio-economic reorganization of agriculture. Phytoplankton variability quantified using Gaussian generalized additive models increased continuously since the onset of agriculture for bloom-forming taxa, did not decline after state change, and suggested that recovery should not be affected by stable-state hysteresis.},

  abstract = {The concepts of ecosystem regime shifts, thresholds and alternative or multiple stable states are used extensively in the ecological and environmental management literature. When applied to aquatic ecosystems, these terms are used inconsistently reflecting differing levels of supporting evidence among ecosystem types. Although many aquatic ecosystems around the world have become degraded, the magnitude and causes of changes, relative to the range of historical variability, are poorly known. A working group supported by the Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) reviewed 135 papers on freshwater ecosystems to assess the evidence for pressure-induced non-linear changes in freshwater ecosystems; these papers used terms indicating sudden and non-linear change in their titles and key words, and so was a positively biased sample. We scrutinized papers for study context and methods, ecosystem characteristics and focus, types of pressures and ecological responses considered, and the type of change reported (i.e., gradual, non-linear, hysteretic or irreversible change). There was little empirical evidence for regime shifts and changes between multiple or alternative stable states in these studies although some shifts between turbid phytoplankton-dominated states and clear-water, macrophyte-dominated states were reported in shallow lakes in temperate climates. We found limited understanding of the subtleties of the relevant theoretical concepts and encountered few mechanistic studies that investigated or identified cause-and-effect relationships between ecological responses and nominal pressures. Our results mirror those of reviews for estuarine, nearshore and marine aquatic ecosystems, demonstrating that although the concepts of regime shifts and alternative stable states have become prominent in the scientific and management literature, their empirical underpinning is weak outside of a specific environmental setting. The application of these concepts in future research and management applications should include evidence on the mechanistic links between pressures and consequent ecological change. Explicit consideration should also be given to whether observed temporal dynamics represent variation along a continuum rather than categorically different states.},

Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics.},

We gradually added top predators to a lake over 3 years to destabilize its food web. An adjacent lake was monitored simultaneously as a reference ecosystem. Warning signals of a regime shift were evident in the manipulated lake during reorganization of the food web more than a year before the food web transition was complete, corroborating theory for leading indicators of ecological regime shifts.

  abstract = {Earth has experienced five major extinction events in the past 450 million years. Many scientists suggest we are now witnessing a sixth, driven by human impacts. However, it has been difficult to quantify the real extent of the current extinction episode, either for a given taxonomic group at the continental scale or for the worldwide biota, largely because comparisons of pre-anthropogenic and anthropogenic biodiversity baselines have been unavailable. Here, we compute those baselines for mammals of temperate North America, using a sampling-standardized rich fossil record to reconstruct species-area relationships for a series of time slices ranging from 30 million to 500 years ago. We show that shortly after humans first arrived in North America, mammalian diversity dropped to become at least 15\%\textendash 42\% too low compared to the ``normal'' diversity baseline that had existed for millions of years. While the Holocene reduction in North American mammal diversity has long been recognized qualitatively, our results provide a quantitative measure that clarifies how significant the diversity reduction actually was. If mass extinctions are defined as loss of at least 75\% of species on a global scale, our data suggest that North American mammals had already progressed one-fifth to more than halfway (depending on biogeographic province) towards that benchmark, even before industrialized society began to affect them. Data currently are not available to make similar quantitative estimates for other continents, but qualitative declines in Holocene mammal diversity are also widely recognized in South America, Eurasia, and Australia. Extending our methodology to mammals in these areas, as well as to other taxa where possible, would provide a reasonable way to assess the magnitude of global extinction, the biodiversity impact of extinctions of currently threatened species, and the efficacy of conservation efforts into the future.},

The methods are exemplified using sea ice extent, and suggest that the loss rate of sea ice accelerated by factor of \textasciitilde 5 in 1996, as reported in other studies, but increases in random fluctuations, as an early warning signal, were observed already in 1990.

  abstract = {Ecological communities are structured in response to spatial and temporal variation of numerous factors, including edaphic conditions, biotic interactions, climatic patterns and disturbance regimes. Widespread anthropogenic factors such as timber harvesting can create long-lasting impacts, obscuring the relationship between community structure and environmental conditions. Minimally impacted systems such as old-growth forests can serve as a useful ecological baseline for predicting long-term compositional shifts. We utilized decadal tree species sampling data (1979\textendash 2010) divided into three strata (understory, midstory, overstory) to examine temporal changes in relative abundances and spatial distributions of dominant taxa, as well as overall shifts in community composition, in a relatively pristine Appalachian old-growth forest in eastern Kentucky, USA. Quercus and Carya species persisted mainly as mature canopy trees with decreasing juvenile recruitment, especially in mesic areas. In contrast, Acer, Fagus, and other mesophytic species were abundant and spatially widespread in subcanopy layers suggesting these species are more likely to recruit in gap-scale canopy openings. In the overstory, mesophytic species were spatially restricted to lower and mid-slope mesic habitats. Temporal changes in community composition were most evident in the understory and tended to be greater in mesic areas, a trend seemingly driven by recruitment failure among xerophytic species. In subcanopy vegetation we discovered a loss of distinction through time among the ecological community designations established following the 1979 survey (Chestnut oak, Mixed mesophytic, and Beech). The overstory was more stable through time, suggesting a storage effect where long-lived trees have maintained a particular community composition through time in areas where regeneration opportunities are minimal under current environmental conditions. Overall, sitewide canopy succession is occurring slowly in the absence of major disturbance, and topography-driven environmental variation appears to have an important local-scale filtering effect on communities.},

One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure2,3,4. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70\% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow ({$<$}1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe5,6. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk7,8.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Multivariate analysis of species assemblage data often begins with transformation of abundances, to downweight contributions from dominant taxa to Bray-Curtis dissimilarities computed among samples. Although usually effective, global transformation is a blunt tool: it ignores differences in the variance structure of counts of individual species. Species which are highly spatially clustered should logically be given less weight than those with similar mean abundance but whose replicate counts have the lower variance associated with Poisson distributions (for which individual organisms arrive randomly and independently into the sample). Where replicates are available within sample groups specified a priori, this differential downweighting is achieved by dividing the counts for each species by their index of dispersion D, the variance to mean ratio, a clustering (`clumping') measure calculated from replicates within a group, and then averaged across groups. The procedure is justified by assuming a generalised Poisson model for counts, allowing different species to have arbitrarily differing degrees of clustering. Downweighting is applied only where a species shows significant evidence of clumping, this being tested by a powerful, exact permutation test that replaces the standard (large-sample) {$\chi$}2 test for D = 1, which is often invalid because of low `expected' frequencies. The resulting dispersion-weighted data matrix has a common (Poisson-like) variance structure across species, but unchanged relative responses of a species in different groups. Transformation may still be needed but now only to downweight consistently abundant species relative to equally consistent but less numerous species, rather than also dealing with erratic counts. Dispersion weighting is shown to be effective in 3 studies that examine: soft-sediment copepods in the metal-polluted Fal estuary, UK; benthic macrofauna of mangrove forests in Bicentennial Park, New South Wales, Australia; and sediment nematodes within and outside seagrass beds in the Yealm estuary, UK. A fourth data set, on macrobenthos from Loch Creran, UK, is added to a comparison of the differing cross-species distributions of the dispersion index.},

For the first time, we identify the main ecological drivers of forest restoration success (defined as a return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) at both the local and landscape scale. These are as follows: the time elapsed since restoration began, disturbance type and landscape context. The time elapsed since restoration began strongly drives restoration success in secondary forests, but not in selectively logged forests (which are more ecologically similar to reference systems). Landscape restoration will be most successful when previous disturbance is less intensive and habitat is less fragmented in the landscape. Restoration does not result in full recovery of biodiversity and vegetation structure, but can complement old-growth forests if there is sufficient time for ecological succession.},

  abstract = {In the vicinity of tipping points\textemdash or more precisely bifurcation points\textemdash ecosystems recover slowly from small perturbations. Such slowness may be interpreted as a sign of low resilience in the sense that the ecosystem could easily be tipped through a critical transition into a contrasting state. Indicators of this phenomenon of `critical slowing down (CSD)' include a rise in temporal correlation and variance. Such indicators of CSD can provide an early warning signal of a nearby tipping point. Or, they may offer a possibility to rank reefs, lakes or other ecosystems according to their resilience. The fact that CSD may happen across a wide range of complex ecosystems close to tipping points implies a powerful generality. However, indicators of CSD are not manifested in all cases where regime shifts occur. This is because not all regime shifts are associated with tipping points. Here, we review the exploding literature about this issue to provide guidance on what to expect and what not to expect when it comes to the CSD-based early warning signals for critical transitions.},

Doing so would address critical questions about long-term ecological processes (spanning {$>$}50~years). * This paper outlines the main barriers to the integration of long-term ecological data (LTE) into management. Using two UK upland case studies, it uses a choice experiment to assess the value placed on LTE by ecological researchers, policymakers and practitioners. Respondents were able to consider how selecting or excluding different sources of evidence might affect management decisions and their environmental outcomes. * The results suggest that LTE has the potential to become a valued part of the evidence base for guiding land-management decisions. * Synthesis and applications. Placing more emphasis on site-based approaches can help translate this potential into practice by demonstrating the practical benefits of using LTE. By working with managers to address site-based issues, palaeoecology can provide additional insights into ecosystem dynamics and critical thresholds. Using LTE can also improve conservation effectiveness by ensuring that both rapid and lagged responses are anticipated and indicating the range of variability against which management responses can be evaluated.},

  abstract = {Managed forests are important landscape components in tropical regions and may contribute to biodiversity conservation. Yet, managing tropical forests sustainably requires an understanding of ecosystem responses to silvicultural interventions. We investigated how silvicultural intervention intensity affects tree species composition and diversity over 30years in the Brazilian Amazon by comparing them to pre-logging conditions and to an unlogged control. The interventions comprised logging in 1982 and thinning in 1993\textendash 1994 and ranged in intensity from 19 to 53\% reduction in the original basal area (BA). Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) {$\geq$}5cm were measured on eight occasions in 41 permanent sample plots of 0.25ha each. Silvicultural intervention intensity influenced both tree species composition and its trajectory within 30years. In contrast, tree species diversity was not impaired. High intervention intensities (with BA reduction{$>$}6.6m2ha-1) had a substantial influence on the community of trees (DBH{$\geq$}10cm), which did not show signs of return to pre-logging species composition. The reduction of BA through harvesting damage and thinning had a stronger effect on species composition than logging of mature trees itself. Thus, damage should be kept to a minimal level and strong thinning interventions should be avoided. This may enhance ecosystem recovery and maintenance of biodiversity at other trophic levels. Since current permitted harvesting intensities in the Brazilian Amazon are lower than the lowest intensity examined in our study, legal harvesting practices are unlikely to cause substantial, long-term changes in tree species composition.},

  abstract = {Questions:  Does fuzzy clustering provide an appropriate numerical framework to manage vegetation classifications? What is the best fuzzy clustering method to achieve this? Material:  We used 531 relev\'es from Catalonia (Spain), belonging to two syntaxonomic alliances of mesophytic and xerophytic montane pastures, and originally classified by experts into nine and 13 associations, respectively. Methods:  We compared the performance of fuzzy C-means (FCM), noise clustering (NC) and possibilistic C-means (PCM) on four different management tasks: (1) assigning new relev\'e data to existing types; (2) updating types incorporating new data; (3) defining new types with unclassified relev\'es; and (4) reviewing traditional vegetation classifications. Results:  As fuzzy classifiers, FCM fails to indicate when a given relev\'e does not belong to any of the existing types; NC might leave too many relev\'es unclassified; and PCM membership values cannot be compared. As unsupervised clustering methods, FCM is more sensitive than NC to transitional relev\'es and therefore produces fuzzier classifications. PCM looks for dense regions in the space of species composition, but these are scarce when vegetation data contain many transitional relev\'es. Conclusions:  All three models have advantages and disadvantages, although the NC model may be a good compromise between the restricted FCM model and the robust but impractical PCM model. In our opinion, fuzzy clustering might provide a suitable framework to manage vegetation classifications using a consistent operational definition of vegetation type. Regardless of the framework chosen, national/regional vegetation classification panels should promote methodological standards for classification practices with numerical tools.},

Given the multiplicity of approaches to classify vegetation, it is important to develop international consensus around a set of general guidelines and purpose-specific standard protocols. Before these goals can be achieved, however, it is necessary to identify and understand the different choices that are made during the process of classifying vegetation. This paper presents a framework to facilitate comparisons between broad-scale plot-based classification approaches. Results Our framework is based on the distinction of four structural elements (plot record, vegetation type, consistent classification section and classification system) and two procedural elements (classification protocol and classification approach). For each element we describe essential properties that can be used for comparisons. We also review alternative choices regarding critical decisions of classification approaches; with a special focus on the procedures used to define vegetation types from plot records. We illustrate our comparative framework by applying it to different broad-scale classification approaches. Conclusions Our framework will be useful for understanding and comparing plot-based vegetation classification approaches, as well as for integrating classification systems and their sections.},

A total of 250 modern pollen spectra (134 spectra contributed by colleagues and an additional 116 spectra that we have collected and counted) provide widespread and relatively uniform coverage across the Southeast. At least one modern pollen spectrum is now available for each 1\textdegree{} latitude by 1\textdegree{} longitude block for the area extending from 29\textdegree{} N to 37\textdegree N and 75\textdegree W to 95\textdegree W. For this region, we have used the most recent Continuous Forest Inventories for merchantable timber to derive estimates of percent growing-stock volume at the spatial scale of both county and larger forest inventory units. For nineteen arboreal taxa, we illustrate contoured maps for precent arboreal pollen (isopoll maps) and percent tree dominance (isophyte maps), as well as scatter plots for pairs of positive percentage values for each taxon. We used geometric-mean linear regression of arboreal pollen percentages against percentages of growing-stock volume to estimate the slope and intercept of a best-fit line and the correlation coefficient of pollen values with tree values. These calibrations are compared with the results of Webb et al. (1981) from the midwestern United States. In these two calibration sets, certain taxa such as Quercus exhibit similar values for both the slope of the regression line and the y-intercept in spite of regional differences in the number and taxonomic composition of Quercus species present. For other taxa such as Pinus, however, the northern and southern groups of species exhibit distinctly different slopes and intercepts. This divergence in calibrations occurs both because different species of Pinus are involved and because pollen productivity of Pinus relative to that of other taxa is different in the two regions. Calibrations of percent arboreal pollen with percent growing-stock volume in the southeastern United States yield new insights that result in a substantive revision in concepts of pollen\textemdash vegetation representation.},

Location\hspace{0.6em} Whangapoua Estuary, Great Barrier Island, northern New Zealand. Methods\hspace{0.6em} Six transects were laid out along a vegetation sequence running from estuarine mud to freshwater swamp. Along these transect lines, 108 plots were sampled for vegetation and surface sediments from wet sand, mud, plant litter or moss (sand and mud sites are inundated by most tides, other sites less frequently). All sediment samples were analysed for pollen. The relationships between plant species frequency and pollen representation were examined at a community scale using twinspan and ordination analyses, and for individual species using fidelity and dispersibility indices, regression and box-plot analyses. Results\hspace{0.6em} The quantitative relationships between source taxon vegetation frequency and its pollen representation varied between species due to differential pollen production and dispersal. twinspan of the surface pollen samples suggests five vegetation types: (A) mangrove (Avicennia marina); (C) Leptocarpus similis salt meadow; (D) Baumea sedges; (E) Leptospermum shrubland; and (F) Typha/Cordyline swamp forest. The (B) Juncus kraussii community is not represented palynologically owing to the destruction of its delicate pollen grains during acetolysis of samples. Detrended correspondence analysis places these communities on an estuarine-to-freshwater gradient. However, pollen assemblages at the seaward end of the salinity gradient are less clearly representative of the associated vegetation than those at the landward end, probably because the open vegetation at the former allows the influx of wind- and water-dispersed pollen from surrounding vegetation. Main conclusions\hspace{0.6em} The vegetation pattern (zonation) at Whangapoua is reflected in the pollen rain. When the long-distance and over-represented pollen types are excluded, five out of six of the broad vegetation communities can be identified by their pollen spectra. Species with high fidelity and low-to-moderate dispersibility indices can be used to identify the vegetation types in the sedimentary sequences. The more open vegetation types at the `marine end' of the sequence tend to be `overwhelmed' by regional pollen, but the nature of the sediments and the presence of discriminatory species (e.g. A. marina, Plagianthus divaricatus, Cordyline australis), even in small amounts, will allow correct identification of the local vegetation represented in sedimentary palynological sequences. A box-plot analysis indicates that the pollen and spore types A. marina (mangroves), Sarcocornia quinqueflora (salt meadow), P. divaricatus (sedges), Gleichenia (shrubland) and C. australis (swamp forest) are highly discriminatory in relation to vegetation type. These discriminatory palynomorphs help with the interpretation of stratigraphic pollen studies. However, salt marsh vegetation communities in the sediments must be interpreted with caution as the marine sediments are easily affected by erosion, bioturbation and tidal inundation effects.},

Thus, we provide a new analytical test of the null model of spatial randomness to understand at which scales, if any, the variance departs significantly from randomness. We also derive the likelihood function that is needed to estimate parameters of spatial models and their uncertainties from observed patterns. The methods are demonstrated through numerical examples and case studies of four tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The methods developed here constitute powerful new tools for investigating effects of ecological processes on spatial point patterns and for statistical inference of process models from spatial patterns.},

The near-annual resolved pollen record shows a gradual shift from a wet to a relatively dry assemblage during the past 100 years. Timing of drainage activities in the region is accurately reflected by the onset and duration of vegetation change in the swamp. The reconstructed vegetation record has been statistically related to pollen assemblages from surface sediment samples. The response range of the FSPSP wetland to environmental perturbations could thus be determined and this allows better understanding of naturally occurring vegetation changes. In addition, the human impact on Florida wetlands becomes increasingly apparent. Superimposed high-frequency variation in the record suggests a positive correlation between winter-precipitation and pollen productivity of the dominant tree taxa. However, further high-resolution analysis is needed to confirm this relation. The response range of the FSPSP wetland to environmental perturbations on both annual- and decadal-scales documented in this study allows recognition and quantification of natural hydrological changes in older deposits from southwest Florida. The strong link between local hydrology and the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation makes the palynological record from FSPSP highly relevant for studying past El Ni\~no\textemdash variability.},

The relative abundance of plant species in the vegetation was studied by sampling three sites adjacent to the sample sites for lake litter. With the exception of ground species and epiphytes there is a good qualitative representation of the forest vegetation composition in the lake litter, and for most of the very common taxa in the forests there is a good quantitative representation also. There are some discrepancies, where taxa are better represented, or less-weD represented than their abundance in the vegetation would suggest. The outstanding instance of this is the very poor representation of swamp monocotyledons and aquatic plants in the lake litter. This is attributed partly to poor preservation offoliage, and partly to over-abundance ofleafand twig detritus from trees and shrubs. Seed are not as common in the lake litter as expected and this may be due to the dilution effect and/or the sifting effect of abundant coarse leaf and twig detritus. Several different modes of entry of plant litter to the lake can be inferred, of which stream transport, direct fall, and wind-carriage seem to be the most important. Some aspects of sedimentation can also be inferred. Much more detailed study is needed before the quantitative relationships between populations of plants in the vegetation and the influx of litter to the lake are properly understood.},

Both methods of direct and indirect gradient analysis are used to describe the altitudinal sequence. The pattern of species abundances over the altitudinal sequence indicated major zones (ecotones) of species compositional change at tree-line and at c. 1050 m. This latter boundary marks the upper altitudinal limit for many important tree species of the lowland and montane forest zones (e.g. Dacrydium cupressinum), and the first appearance of species characteristic of the sub-alpine forest zone (e.g. Phyllocladus alpinus and Dacrydium biforme). Ordinations of stand density and basal area data using Detrended Correspondece Analysis (DCA) revealed a highly significant correlation between stand loadings on the first axis and altitude. Furthermore, a break in the altitudinal arrangement of sample stands is apparent at c. 1050 m, confirming the change from montane to sub-alpine forest suggested by the indirect gradient analysis results. Classification of stands and species using Two-way indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) did not identify the same break in the altitudinal sequence until the second division. Reasons for this are discussed. The arrangement of communities and ecotones on Mt Hauhungatahi is compared with data for other mountains in New Zealand.},

Scientists worldwide are looking at the ecological and hydrological impacts resulting from climate change. Climate change will make future efforts to restore and manage wetlands more complex. Wetland systems are vulnerable to changes in quantity and quality of their water supply, and it is expected that climate change will have a pronounced effect on wetlands through alterations in hydrological regimes with great global variability. Wetland habitat responses to climate change and the implications for restoration will be realized differently on a regional and mega-watershed level, making it important to recognize that specific restoration and management plans will require examination by habitat. Floodplains, mangroves, seagrasses, saltmarshes, arctic wetlands, peatlands, freshwater marshes and forests are very diverse habitats, with different stressors and hence different management and restoration techniques are needed. The Sundarban (Bangladesh and India), Mekong river delta (Vietnam), and southern Ontario (Canada) are examples of major wetland complexes where the effects of climate change are evolving in different ways. Thus, successful long term restoration and management of these systems will hinge on how we choose to respond to the effects of climate change. How will we choose priorities for restoration and research? Will enough water be available to rehabilitate currently damaged, water-starved wetland ecosystems?

Methods\hspace{0.6em} A survey was undertaken of surface-pollen samples from the major regional vegetation types: alpine, rain forest and moorland. Relationships between vegetation type and surface-pollen representation were analysed using twinspan classification and ordination. A core was retrieved from moorland vegetation, and interpretation of the fossil pollen sequence was aided using relationships detected in our surface-pollen analysis. Results\hspace{0.6em} Regional vegetation types are reflected in the pollen rain of south-west Tasmania, despite the over-representation of important rain forest tree species in samples from non-forest sites. twinspan classification of the surface-pollen samples identified the following indicator pollen taxa for each vegetation type: Astelia alpina (alpine); Lagarostrobos franklinii (rain forest); Leptospermum and Melaleuca (moorland). Detrended correspondence analysis of the surface-pollen samples clearly separates samples from each vegetation type. Correlation of the ordination axes with environmental data identified a dominant temperature/altitudinal gradient in the surface-pollen data (R~=~0.852/0.844). Application of the results of the surface-pollen analysis to the fossil sequence revealed that fire-promoted moorland has dominated the local environment around the core site for the entire Holocene. Changes in fossil pollen composition also suggest that temperatures increased through the Late Glacial to peak in the mid-Holocene and declined thereafter, a trend consistent with other sites in the region. Main conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Pollen spectra can successfully be used to predict local vegetation in south-west Tasmania. At least this part of inland south-west Tasmania has remained forest-free throughout the Holocene, conflicting with the dominant palaeoecological paradigm of a mid-Holocene dominated by rain forest. A comparison with pollen records from moorland vegetation across the region suggests that fire-promoted moorland has dominated the landscape since the Late Glacial. We suggest that burning by people through the Late Glacial (if not earlier) facilitated the spread of moorland throughout the region, greatly restricting the expansion of rain forest. The continued influence of fire throughout the Holocene in this perennially wet landscape argues for a revision of the dominant human-occupation model that depicts an abandonment of the interior of south-west Tasmania in the Late Glacial in response to the expansion of rain forest.},

Temperature (altitude) and fire frequency are significantly correlated with the ordination axes, consistent with the ecology of the region, indicating that pollen composition is a good reflection of vegetation and that pollen spectra can be effectively used to reconstruct changes in these environmental parameters. Moorland communities are clearly distinguished by ordination analysis. Seasonality is significantly correlated with moorland community type. Although percentage cover of the major plant taxa correlates significantly in most cases with pollen percentages, the high variability means that quantitative estimates of vegetation cover from pollen data alone are not possible.},

Few studies have quantified the differences among results when employing various methods on a single stratigraphic series of paleocommunities. Here, we examined fossils collected from the Rapid Member of the Little Cedar Formation of Coralville, Iowa, USA and the Waterways Formation of northern Alberta, Canada to compare the paleocommunity results between the use of abundance versus point counts as a counting method and between using all taxa in a paleocommunity versus only the brachiopod taxa. Comparisons between abundance and point count categorizations resulted in goodness-of-fit statistics ranging from 0.61 to 0.92. In addition, we visually assessed each of the ordination comparisons and interpreted each categorization comparison as leading to different paleocommunity interpretations. Colonial and easily disarticulated taxa (i.e., crinoids and bryozoans) had a strong influence on the differences between abundance and point count categorizations; when the colonial and easily disarticulated taxa were culled and the analyses rerun, goodness-of-fit statistics increased. When possible, we recommend the use of both abundance and point counts when conducting paleocommunity analyses. However, because point counts allow the equal weighting of solitary, non-solitary, and easily disarticulated taxa, point counts may be a more accurate means of measuring taxonomic composition of paleocommunities. Furthermore, because of the disparity between the paleocommunity results of brachiopods-only versus all-taxa, we recommend the use of all taxa for environmental, ecological, or evolutionary research based on paleocommunities.},

Inherent technical constraints often limit the possibility to obtain from sediment both regular and high-resolution time series rather most palaeoecological time series obtained from sediment records represent time-aggregated ecological signals. In this study, the robustness of EWS detection to temporal aggregation was addressed using simulated time series mimicking ecological dynamics. Using a stochastic differential equation based on a deterministic model exhibiting a critical transition between two stable equilibria, two different scenarios were simulated using different combinations of forcing and noise intensities (critical slowing-down and driver-mediated flickering scenarios). The temporal resolution of each simulated time series was progressively decreased by averaging the data from {$\Delta$}t = 1 up to {$\Delta$}t = 10 time-unit intervals. EWSs (standard deviation, autocorrelation at lag-1 (AR(1)), skewness and kurtosis) were applied to all time series. Robustness of EWSs to data aggregation was assessed through a block-based approach using Kendall rank correlation Tau. Standard deviation appeared to be robust to data aggregation up to {$\Delta$}t = 10 for the slowing-down scenario and up to {$\Delta$}t = 5 for the driver-mediated flickering scenario while autocorrelation remained robust up to {$\Delta$}t = 2 for the slowing-down scenario and did not support data aggregation for the driver-mediated scenario. Skewness and kurtosis performed poorly for the two scenarios and were not considered as robust EWSs even for the original simulated time series using the block-based approach. Our results suggest that high-resolution palaeoecological time series could be in a large extent suitable to support EWS analyses.},

However, diversity patterns vary across spatial scales. Here, we examined the effects of farming system (organic vs. conventional) and position in the field (edge vs. center) on plant species richness in wheat fields at three spatial scales. We quantified {$\alpha$}-, {$\beta$}-, and {$\gamma$}-diversity at the microscale in 800 plots, at the mesoscale in 40 fields, and at the macroscale in three regions using the additive partitioning approach, and evaluated the relative contribution of {$\beta$}-diversity at each spatial scale to total observed species richness. We found that {$\alpha$}-, {$\beta$}-, and {$\gamma$}-diversity were higher in organic than conventional fields and higher at the field edge than in the field center at all spatial scales. In both farming systems, {$\beta$}-diversity at the meso- and macroscale explained most of the overall species richness (up to 37\% and 25\%, respectively), indicating considerable differences in community composition among fields and regions due to environmental heterogeneity. The spatial scale at which {$\beta$}-diversity contributed the most to overall species richness differed between rare and common species. Total richness of rare species (present in {$\leq$}5\% of total samples) was mainly explained by differences in community composition at the meso- and macroscale (up to 27\% and 48\%, respectively), but only in organic fields. Total richness of common species (present in {$\geq$}25\% of total samples) was explained by differences in community composition at the micro- and mesoscale (up to 29\% and 47\%, respectively), i.e., among plots and fields, independent of farming system. Our results show that organic farming made the greatest contribution to total species richness at the meso (among fields) and macro (among regions) scale due to environmental heterogeneity. Hence, agri-environment schemes should exploit this large-scale contribution of {$\beta$}-diversity by tailoring schemes at regional scales to maximize dissimilarity between conservation areas using geographic information systems rather than focusing entirely at the classical local-field scale, which is the current practice.},

Are tree and non-tree assemblages structured by the same factors? Location Atlantic Rain Forest, restored by planting an assemblage of high-diversity tree species, Brazil. Methods We measured plant colonization of restoration sites of different ages to evaluate restoration success in terms of species diversity, colonization by non-tree species and structure measures among stands. We used Procrustes analysis to test whether the same conditions that influence tree composition influence non-tree composition (congruence between non-trees and trees present on the same sites). Results Many structural aspects of recovering forests, e.g. tree basal area, canopy cover, height, tree richness, and non-tree floristic composition resembled a mature forest within five decades. Although tree species diversity increased according to restoration age of sites, planted sites did not recover the richness of all growth forms even after five decades of restoration, and particularly lacked climbers and epiphytes. We detected significant similarity between corresponding points (tree and non-tree composition) from separate ordinations only in the reference forest. Therefore, naturally assembled communities are more concordant than those originating from active restoration. Conclusion Non-tree assemblages respond to different factors than the tree assemblages in restoration sites. Hence, non-tree recovery may not result as a natural consequence of tree recovery, and specific restoration strategies for non-tree species must be applied. Tree richness recovered after two decades. Only half of the non-tree species richness was recovered in old restoration sites, but their composition similarity reached expected levels of reference values. Further studies will investigate if low richness of non-tree species is a consequence of low input of allochthonous propagules (landscape filter) or whether they are arriving but not establishing (environmental filter). Enrichment planting of non-tree species may be required if the problem is propagule input. We recommend enrichment planting should be implemented within 10~yrs after initial restoration planting because of the need for trees as supporting structures.

  abstract = {The vertical distribution of foraminifera, testate amoebae and diatoms was investigated in saltmarshes in the Taf estuary (south Wales), the Erme estuary (south Devon) and the Brancaster marshes (north Norfolk), to assess the use of multiproxy indicators in sea-level reconstructions. A total of 116 samples were subjected to regression analyses, using the program calibrate, with duration of tidal flooding as the dependent variable. We found that the relationship between flooding duration and taxa was strongest for diatoms and testate amoebae and weakest for foraminifera. The vertical range of testate amoebae in saltmarshes is small. Their lower tolerance limit in present-day saltmarshes occurs where tides cover the marsh less than a combined total of 7 days (1.9\%) in a year. However, they are important sea-level indicators because information for sea-level reconstruction is best derived from sediments that originate in the highest part of the intertidal zone. Diatoms span the entire sampled range in intertidal and supratidal areas, whereas the upper limit of foraminifera is found very close to the highest astronomical tide level. Local training sets provide reconstructions with higher accuracy and precision than combined training sets, but their use is limited if they do not represent adequate modern analogues for fossil assemblages. Although analyses are time consuming, a regional training set of all three groups of micro-organisms yields highly accurate (r2 = 0.80) and precise (low value of root mean square error) predictions of tidal level. This approach therefore could improve the accuracy and precision of Holocene sea-level reconstructions. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Conceptual confusion revolves around how to define, assess, and overcome land, ecosystem, and landscape degradation. Common elements link degradation and recovery processes, offering ways to advance local, regional, and global initiatives to reduce degradation and promote the recovery of ecosystems and landscapes in forest biomes. Biophysical attributes of degradation and recovery can be measured, but the relevance of selected attributes across scales is subject to values that determine preferred states. Degradation defined in the context of a resilience-based approach is a state where the capacity for regeneration is greatly reduced or lost, recovery is arrested, core interactions and feedbacks are broken, and human intervention is required to initiate a trajectory of recovery. Another approach combines degradation and recovery processes through the concept of recovery debt, the cumulative lost benefits incurred, relative to a target state during phases of degradation and recovery. Degradation and recovery can also be described in terms of societal willingness to invest in improved management or restoration. Interventions can facilitate recovery to new stable or persistent states that provide multiple social and ecological benefits at land, ecosystem, and landscape scales. Multiple trajectories of recovery, as well as historic and ongoing chronic environmental change, might, however, mean that recovery to an original reference state is not possible.}

This allows for the construction of increasingly precise maps of Holocene vegetation change across the continent.

Here we present new chronologies for most of the datasets stored in the EPD based on calibrated radiocarbon years. Age information associated with pollen diagrams is often derived from the pollen stratigraphy itself or from other sedimentological information. We reviewed these chronological tie points and assigned uncertainties to them. The steps taken to generate the new chronologies are described and the rationale for a new classification system for age uncertainties is introduced. The resulting chronologies are fit for most continental-scale questions. They may not provide the best age model for particular sites, but may be viewed as general purpose chronologies. Taxonomic particularities of the data stored in the EPD are explained. An example is given of how the database can be queried to select samples with appropriate age control as well as the suitable taxonomic level to answer a specific research question.},

The paper addresses (1) field methods for the development of spatially-explicit models of forest dynamics and their integration in models of forest dynamics, (2) strengths and limitations of traditional patch models versus spatially-explicit, individual-based models, and (3) the potential for moment-based methods in the analysis of forest dynamics. These topics are discussed with reference to their potential for solving open questions in the studies of forest dynamics. The study of spatio-temporal processes provides a link between pattern and process in plant communities, and plays a crucial role in understanding ecosystem dynamics. In the last decade, the development of spatially-explicit, individual-based models shifted the focus of forest dynamics modelling from the dynamics of discrete patches to the interactions among individual organisms, thus encapsulating the theory of ``neighbourhood'' dynamics. In turn, the stochastic properties and the complexity of spatially-explicit, individual-based models gave rise to the development of a new suite of so-called moment-based models. These new models describe the dynamics of individuals and of pairs of individuals in terms of their densities, thus directly capturing second-order information on spatial structure. So far, this approach has not been applied to forests; we indicate extensions needed for such applications. Moment-based models may be an important complement to spatially explicit individual-based models in developing a general spatial theory of forest dynamics. However, both kinds of models currently focus on fine scales, whereas a critical issue in forest dynamics is to understand the interaction of fine-scale processes with coarser-scale disturbances. To obtain a more complete picture of forest dynamics, the relevant links and interactions between fine-, intermediate-, and coarse-scale processes ought to be identified. Intensive links between modelling work and field studies designed across different scales are a promising means to create a new perspective on forest dynamics.},

The plant cuticle record reveals the early-Holocene development of a swamp and its transition to a raised bog, which is not apparent from other proxies. Comparison with a pollen record from the same sequence highlights the advantages of plant cuticle analysis in cases where pollen is hard to identify or poorly preserved. In particular, distinguishing between the pollen grains of the two main bog species, the restiads Empodisma robustum and Sporadanthus ferrugineus, relies on subtle gradational characteristics, whereas their cuticular patterns are very distinct. Furthermore, Cyperaceae pollen is poorly preserved at Moanatuatua Bog, being almost completely absent, whereas the Cyperaceae cuticles are present throughout the sequence. Therefore, we suggest that Cyperaceae pollen at this site is a less reliable indicator of local sedge communities than the cuticle record. The wide dispersal capabilities of these wind-dispersed pollen types also make them less suitable for determining local site vegetation and environmental change in comparison with cuticle remains. These results suggest that plant cuticle analysis may be a useful tool for the reconstruction of long-term vegetation changes from peat sequences, especially when used in concert with palynology. Sample preparation also proved to be fast with little equipment or chemicals needed.},

  abstract = {A globally consistent methodology using satellite imagery was implemented to quantify gross forest cover loss (GFCL) from 2000 to 2005 and to compare GFCL among biomes, continents, and countries. GFCL is defined as the area of forest cover removed because of any disturbance, including both natural and human-induced causes. GFCL was estimated to be 1,011,000 km2 from 2000 to 2005, representing 3.1\% (0.6\% per year) of the year 2000 estimated total forest area of 32,688,000 km2. The boreal biome experienced the largest area of GFCL, followed by the humid tropical, dry tropical, and temperate biomes. GFCL expressed as the proportion of year 2000 forest cover was highest in the boreal biome and lowest in the humid tropics. Among continents, North America had the largest total area and largest proportion of year 2000 GFCL. At national scales, Brazil experienced the largest area of GFCL over the study period, 165,000 km2, followed by Canada at 160,000 km2. Of the countries with {$>$}1,000,000 km2 of forest cover, the United States exhibited the greatest proportional GFCL and the Democratic Republic of Congo the least. Our results illustrate a pervasive global GFCL dynamic. However, GFCL represents only one component of net change, and the processes driving GFCL and rates of recovery from GFCL differ regionally. For example, the majority of estimated GFCL for the boreal biome is due to a naturally induced fire dynamic. To fully characterize global forest change dynamics, remote sensing efforts must extend beyond estimating GFCL to identify proximate causes of forest cover loss and to estimate recovery rates from GFCL.},

Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains. Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change. Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012.

The RSAP of small basins (bogs or lakes) in the past has to be estimated if quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation at the local spatial scale is to be achieved using Sugita's Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA). In this study we apply a forward modelling approach to estimate past RSAP using the computer simulation model HUMPOL. The landscape designs are based on past landscape maps produced using a combination of palaeobotanical, archaeological and historical data, and the area's geology and soil characteristics. Four time windows characterised by different landscape/land-use were selected, i.e. Early Neolithic, Late Bronze Age, Viking Age, and Middle Ages. We found that RSAP estimates for hypothetical past landscapes in Sk\aa ne differ by ca. 600~m to 1200~m between the selected time periods, whatever the size of the basin (lake or bog, 25\textendash 250~m radius). The most probable explanation for the differences in RSAP between time slices is variable patch size and spatial distribution of patches in the landscape. The RSAPs vary between ca. 1200 and 2300~m for small basins (25~m and 70~m radius), and between ca. 2000 and 3000~m for larger basins (250~m radius). These values are within the range of earlier estimates of modern and past RSAPs for southern Scandinavia obtained using simulated or empirical data. These results suggest that, given the type of setting of that region in terms of taxa composition and traditional land-use, the RSAP for small-size lakes (25\textendash 250~m radius) will generally be in the range ca. 1200\textendash 3000~m. The forward modelling approach is found to be useful to assess the possible effects on RSAP of changes in vegetation/landscape characteristics between different periods of the past. Moreover, comparison of RSAP estimates obtained using both the forward and backward modelling approaches will be important to identify the most credible RSAP estimates for the past.},

BACI (Before\textendash After and Control\textendash Impact) sampling and analysis is often recommended to overcome the problem of inferring that changes are due to an impact rather than natural variability. Using five different BACI design and analysis techniques (from nested ANOVA to time-series intervention) on data with spatial, temporal, and sampling variability at scales relevant to impact assessments, we investigated how BACI designs cope with interactions between spatial and temporal variability and whether natural variability is best treated as random. A number of simulated impacts of different sizes and types were imposed on long-term observations of six macrofaunal species and three diversity indices. A major problem in detecting the impacts was the differences in variability between sites, although the statistical detection of impacts was aided by treating temporal variability as an underlying process with structure, rather than random noise. However, the sensitivity of any method depended on the spatial and temporal variability exhibited by the ecological measure. Our results emphasize that scale is one of the most important concepts in impact assessment. As spatial or temporal scale increases, both the number of processes and their importance in influencing local populations and communities will change, increasing the variability encompassed by the study. We suggest monitoring a number of variables (populations) and developing sampling strategies that enable a number of methods of analysis to be employed.},

Ordination arranged sites along an open to densely structured vegetation gradient, i.e. from fernland and tussockland to forest and dense scrub. Stepwise discriminant analysis selected the pollen proportion of Myrsine (subalpine scrub), Gleichenia (subalpine fernland), Libocedrus (subalpine forest) and Restionaceae (subalpine tussockland) as highly discriminatory variables in relation to vegetation type. High Weinmannia, Nestegis and Cyathea smithii-type pollen values characterized the montane forest.

Failure to account for these key data properties can lead to misleading results. * A model-based approach to unconstrained ordination can address this issue, and in this study, two types of models for ordination are proposed based on finite mixture models and latent variable models. Each method is capable of handling different data types and different forms of species response to latent gradients. Further strengths of the models are demonstrated via example and simulation. * Advantages of model-based approaches to ordination include the following: residual analysis tools for checking assumptions to ensure the fitted model is appropriate for the data; model selection tools to choose the most appropriate model for ordination; methods for formal statistical inference to draw conclusions from the ordination; and improved efficiency, that is model-based ordination better recovers true relationships between sites, when used appropriately.},

Our sites were concentrated in two regions, one dominated by Tsuga and hardwood (Acer, Betula, Fagus) forests, and the other by Tsuga, Pinus, Betula, Acer and Quercus forests. 2 Our results confirm that forest-floor pollen assemblages are dominated by pollen originating from trees growing more than 20 m from the site of deposition. However, our results suggest that background pollen percentages were overestimated by Jackson \& Wong in 1994, owing to unusually high Pinus pollen production in the year of their sampling. 3 Expansion of our vegetation sampling radius from 20 to 120 m resulted in modest but consistent improvement in model fit and a decrease in background pollen percentages. 4 ERV model parameters (slope and background) differed substantially between the two study regions, primarily owing to differences in background pollen productivity and dispersal from regional sources. 5 High background pollen percentages may lead to poor estimation of calibration parameters in regions of complex vegetation patterns. Expansion of the vegetation sampling radius to reduce the background component may lead to better parameter estimates. 6 Calibration of pollen-vegetation relationships requires definition of the vegetation term so that it approximates the vegetation sampled by the pollen assemblages. Critical challenges are to define better the appropriate vegetation sampling area and distance-weighting functions for application to pollen-vegetation calibration.},

The most widely applied model is Prentice's model, which uses a modified form of Sutton's equation for atmospheric diffusion to predict pollen-source areas from size of the depositional basin and a set of depositional parameters (deposition velocity of the pollen grains and mean wind speed) and atmospheric parameters (turbulence parameter, vertical diffusion coefficient). We review the physical theory underlying Sutton's equation and Prentice's model, explore the effects of different values of the depositional and atmospheric parameters on model predictions, and provide prescriptions for model application, parameter specification, and further research on pollen dispersal. Most applications of the models to pollen dispersal have assumed neutral atmospheric conditions. We argue that most pollen dispersal takes place in unstable atmospheric conditions, and prescribe appropriate values for the atmospheric parameters for unstable conditions. Our simulations using these parameters indicate more widespread pollen dispersal from a source than under neutral conditions. We review available data sets for sedimentation velocity of pollen grains, and compare the measured estimates with sedimentation velocities predicted from Stokes's Law to assess validity of the data. Substantial variability exists among data sets, but several are suitable for application to pollen-dispersal models. Finally, we discuss aspects of release, dispersal, and deposition of anemophilous pollen that are in need of further theoretical and empirical study. Such studies will contribute not only to Quaternary plant ecology but also to understanding of pollination biology, population genetics, and functional morphology of pollen grains and pollen-bearing organs.},

Their co-occurrence within a spruce\textendash moss forest matrix suggests the existence of alternative stable states. We investigate the possibility of these spruce\textendash lichen woodlands as an alternative stable state along with the factors contributing to their origin and spatiotemporal distribution. Analysis of plant macrofossils, charcoal, head capsules of defoliating insects, and pollen were used along with vegetation surveys to reconstruct the past and present disturbance dynamics along an east\textendash west transect, corresponding to a precipitation and fire frequency gradient. At each site, spruce budworm head capsules were found preceding the charcoal layer delineating the shift to spruce\textendash lichen woodland, demonstrating the compound disturbance (insect\textendash fire) origin of the lichen woodlands. Moss forests previously occupied all lichen woodland sites, with the oldest record starting ca. 8300\textendash 9400 yr BP. A change to a higher fire frequency around 2500 yr BP was evident in the lichen woodland zone of the park. A lower fire frequency west of the lichen woodland zone likely is a result of orographic precipitation. While the spruce budworm affects the entire region, lichen woodlands are found exclusively within an increased fire frequency zone. Thus, it is the superimposition of these two disturbance factors that is responsible both for their creation and spatial distribution. Lichen woodland inception dates range between 580 and 1440 yr BP, demonstrating that these lichen woodlands have maintained their open structure with time and have not transformed into closed forests. Their persistence, along with their previous moss forest histories and current occurrence adjacent to closed moss forests, indicate that they are an alternative stable state to the spruce\textendash moss forests and not a successional stage. In contrast to other examples of reported alternative stable states, this one is a result of natural disturbances inherent to the system and not anthropogenic impacts.},

  abstract = {All ecological communities experience change over time. One method to quantify temporal variation in the patterns of relative abundance of communities is time lag analysis (TLA). It uses a distance-based approach to study temporal community dynamics by regressing community dissimilarity over increasing time lags (one-unit lags, two-unit lags, three-unit lags). Here, we suggest some modifications to the method and revaluate its potential for detecting patterns of community change. We apply Hellinger distance based TLA to artificial data simulating communities with different levels of directional and stochastic dynamics and analyse their effects on the slope and its statistical significance. We conclude that statistical significance of the TLA slope (obtained by a Monte Carlo permutation procedure) is a valid criterion to discriminate between (i) communities with directional change in species composition, regardless whether it is caused by directional abundance change of the species or by stochastic change according to a Markov process, and (ii) communities that are composed of species with population sizes oscillating around a constant mean or communities whose species abundances are governed by a white noise process. TLA slopes range between 0.02 and 0.25, depending on the proportions of species with different dynamics; higher proportions of species with constant means imply shallower slopes; and higher proportions of species with stochastic dynamics or directional change imply steeper slopes. These values are broadly in line with TLA slopes from real world data. Caution must be exercised when TLA is used for the comparison of community time series with different lengths since the slope depends on time series length and tends to decrease non-linearly with it.},

Another approach for visualizing ecosystem stability, resistance, and resilience involves ordinations of repeated measures of community data or environmental variables and tracking trajectories over time in ordination space. Interestingly, the two approaches have not been linked in a meaningful way.

  abstract = {Understanding how communities respond to natural disturbances is fundamental to assess the mechanisms of ecosystem resistance and resilience. However, ecosystem responses to natural disturbances are rarely monitored both through space and time, while the factors promoting ecosystem stability act at various temporal and spatial scales. Hence, assessing both the spatial and temporal variations in species composition is important to comprehensively explore the effects of natural disturbances. Here, we suggest a framework to better scrutinize the mechanisms underlying community responses to disturbances through both time and space. Our analytical approach is based on beta diversity decomposition into two components, replacement and biomass difference. We illustrate this approach using a 9-year monitoring of coral reef fish communities off Moorea Island (French Polynesia), which encompassed two severe natural disturbances: a crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak and a hurricane. These disturbances triggered a fast logistic decline in coral cover, which suffered a 90\% decrease on all reefs. However, we found that the coral reef fish composition remained largely stable through time and space whereas compensatory changes in biomass among species were responsible for most of the temporal fluctuations, as outlined by the overall high contribution of the replacement component to total beta diversity. This suggests that, despite the severity of the two disturbances, fish communities exhibited high resistance and the ability to reorganize their compositions to maintain the same level of total community biomass as before the disturbances. We further investigated the spatial congruence of this pattern and showed that temporal dynamics involved different species across sites; yet, herbivores controlling the proliferation of algae that compete with coral communities were consistently favored. These results suggest that compensatory changes in biomass among species and spatial heterogeneity in species responses can provide further insurance against natural disturbances in coral reef ecosystems by promoting high levels of key species (herbivores). They can also allow the ecosystem to recover more quickly.},

  abstract = {Natural resource managers have used natural variability concepts since the early 1960s and are increasingly relying on these concepts to maintain biological diversity, to restore ecosystems that have been severely altered, and as benchmarks for assessing anthropogenic change. Management use of natural variability relies on two concepts: that past conditions and processes provide context and guidance for managing ecological systems today, and that disturbance-driven spatial and temporal variability is a vital attribute of nearly all ecological systems. We review the use of these concepts for managing ecological systems and landscapes. We conclude that natural variability concepts provide a framework for improved understanding of ecological systems and the changes occurring in these systems, as well as for evaluating the consequences of proposed management actions. Understanding the history of ecological systems (their past composition and structure, their spatial and temporal variability, and the principal processes that influenced them) helps managers set goals that are more likely to maintain and protect ecological systems and meet the social values desired for an area. Until we significantly improve our understanding of ecological systems, this knowledge of past ecosystem functioning is also one of the best means for predicting impacts to ecological systems today. These concepts can also be misused. No a priori time period or spatial extent should be used in defining natural variability. Specific goals, site-specific field data, inferences derived from data collected elsewhere, simulation models, and explicitly stated value judgment all must drive selection of the relevant time period and spatial extent used in defining natural variability. Natural variability concepts offer an opportunity and a challenge for ecologists to provide relevant information and to collaborate with managers to improve the management of ecological systems.},

Collected diatom samples were enumerated to 250 valves and identified to species or subspecies. An assessment of wetland condition was made using a landscape-scale human disturbance score (Landscape Development Intensity index, LDI), calculated for each site using land use maps and GIS. Assemblages from both impaired and reference sites were compared using blocked multi-response permutation procedures, the percent similarity index, and visually examined using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). No ecologically significant compositional differences were found within sites. Mantel's test (Mantel's r=0.29, p{$<$}0.0001) and NMDS (stress: 14.52, variance: 78.5\%) identified epiphytic diatoms as the most responsive to human disturbance. Strong significant correlations (|rs|{$>$}0.50, p{$<$}0.05) were found between epiphytic NMDS site scores and soil pH, specific conductivity, water total phosphorous, and LDI, while soil pH, water color, soil TP, and turbidity were also significantly correlated (p{$<$}0.05). Metrics to assess wetland condition were developed using epiphytic abundance data. Epiphytic taxa sensitive or tolerant to human landscape modification were identified using Indicator Species Analysis, and autecological indices relating diatom sensitivity to nutrients, pH, dissolved oxygen levels, saprobity, salinity, and trophic status were calculated. Fourteen final metrics were identified, scored on an ordinal scale, and combined into the Diatom Index of Wetland Condition (DIWC). The DIWC was highly correlated with the disturbance score (Spearman's rs=-0.71, p{$<$}0.0001), although the results need to be validated.},

Temporal beta diversity is measured by the variance of the multivariate community composition time series and that variance can be partitioned using appropriate statistical methods. Some of these methods are classical, such as simple or canonical ordination, whereas others are recent, including the methods of temporal eigenfunction analysis developed for multiscale exploration (i.e. addressing several scales of variation) of univariate or multivariate response data, reviewed, to our knowledge for the first time in this review. These methods are illustrated with ecological data from 13 years of benthic surveys in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The following methods are applied to the Chesapeake data: distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps, asymmetric eigenvector maps, scalogram, variation partitioning, multivariate correlogram, multivariate regression tree, and two-way MANOVA to study temporal and space\textendash time variability. Local (temporal) contributions to beta diversity (LCBD indices) are computed and analysed graphically and by regression against environmental variables, and the role of species in determining the LCBD values is analysed by correlation analysis. A tutorial detailing the analyses in the R language is provided in an appendix.},

Analysis is based on a precise relationship between pollen assemblages and vegetation types and a re-assessment of Plant Functional Types and biomes at a sub-continental scale. The results show that the 13 main vegetation types described in western Africa are correctly defined by pollen data (both main pollen types and percentages) and both annual and seasonal climate parameters can be assigned to each of them. This includes distinction between the northern and southern types of dry rain forest from Cameroon and Congo and between tropical and non-tropical desert areas. Biomes are correctly reconstructed for all the vegetation types except for the tropical dry forest (TDFO) in the Sudanian vegetation zone (probably due to the strong anthropogenic disturbance of the natural landscape) and the tropical rain forest (TRFO) near the Equator (due to the highly complex biology of the rain forest, still poorly studied).},

I present four general principles to guide strategies aimed at meeting these challenges: (1) protect and restore populations of key species and their habitats, (2) conserve and restore key attributes of stand structural complexity, (3) maintain and restore natural patterns of landscape heterogeneity, and (4) maintain and restore key ecological processes. The complexity associated with these principles is that how they will be practically implemented on the ground will invariably be ecosystem specific as what constitutes stand structural complexity or landscape heterogeneity will vary between ecosystems. Here I demonstrate the practical application of the four general principles in a detailed case study of conservation and restoration in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. These forests are characterized by declining species, loss of key elements of stand structural, loss of old growth forest, altered patterns of landscape heterogeneity, and altered ecosystem processes. I highlight how altered management practices in Mountain Ash forests that are guided by our four general principles can help conserve existing biodiversity and underpin effective forest restoration. Consideration of our general principles also can identify policy deficiencies that need to be addressed to enhance restoration and biodiversity conservation.},

However, human perception seldom goes back to the beginning of significant ecosystem degradation, making ecosystem assessment and restoration practices difficult. Long-term data, historical records, and paleoecological information can increase our understanding of ecological responses to natural or anthropogenic impacts and can directly contribute to the understanding and design of effective restoration practices. Here, examples from different ecosystems (drylands, grasslands, shrublands, savannas, forests, coastal environments, and wetlands) brought together from around the world illustrate (1) how to develop appropriate restoration references under the current uncertain global change scenario; (2) how long-term perspectives on drivers of change can help to identify critical ecological elements, thus contributing to defining restoration goals; and (3) how to incorporate information from the past as guidance for present interventions and landscape management. The building of community and the specificity of paleoecological and historical records of ecological change over time will be key in facilitating the translation of long-term information into the living process of ecological restoration practice.},

We aim to provide first analysis of statistically significant charcoal-inferred fire events from a peatland from central European lowlands, spanning the period of the last 650 years, and define peatland vegetation and microbial trait-related responses to local fire events. Here, we reconstructed regional and local fire activity from Bagno Kusowo bog (Poland) using high-resolution microscopic charcoal and macroscopic charcoal and its morphotypes, inferring past fire regimes using numeric analyses. We compared fire data with extra-local (pollen) and local (plant macrofossils, testate amoebae (TA) and their trait composition) proxies. Our data show that within the chronological uncertainties, regional fires recorded in the peat core coincide with historically-documented fires. Macroscopic charcoal analysis suggests 3\textendash 8 local fire events, while fire frequency varied between 0 and 2 events/1000 years. Wood charcoal was dominant throughout the profile, pointing to forest fires in close proximity to the peatland. Local fire activity was the most intensive in the 17th century, when the water table was at its lowest. The abundance of Sphagnum spp. declined, whereas vascular plants, mixotrophs and TA with proteinaceous shells were significantly positively correlated to fire. Xenosomes were significantly negatively correlated to fires, and they responded to water table lowering. We show that the peatlands' vegetation recovered from low-intensity and short-lasting disturbances and, to some extent, maintained ``pristine'' local vegetation cover with Sphagnum as the dominant taxon. TA traits common before disturbances, mainly mixotrophs and TA with proteinaceous shells, temporarily re-appeared after fire. We conclude that TA communities in peatlands are good bioindicators of disturbances.},

We briefly review the history of theoretical and empirical perspectives on community change, and propose a new framework for viewing temporal trajectories of communities in multivariate space. We used a stream fish dataset spanning 40 years (1969\textendash 2008) in southern Oklahoma, USA, emphasizing our own 1981\textendash 2008 collections which included well-documented, extreme drought and flood events, to assess dynamics of and environmental factors affecting the fish community. We evaluated the trajectory of the Brier Creek community in multivariate space relative to trajectories in 27 published studies, and for Brier Creek fish, tested hypotheses about gradual versus event-driven changes and persistence of shifts to alternate states. Most species were persistent, qualitatively, across the four decades, but varied widely in abundance, with some having unusually strong reproduction after extreme droughts. The community had an early period of relatively gradual and directional change, but greater displacement than predicted at random after two consecutive extreme droughts midway through the study (1998 and 2000). But, the community subsequently returned toward its former state in the last decade. This fish community is characterized by species that are tolerant of environmental extremes, and have life history traits that facilitate population recovery. The community appears ``loosely stable'' about a long-term average condition, but the impacts of the two consecutive droughts were substantial, and may foretell future dynamics of this or other communities in a changed global climate if disturbance events become more frequent or severe.},

The sampled vegetation includes all major community types: maritime turf and grassland, sedge flushes, dwarf forest, scrub, cushion bog, tussock grassland, and high altitude graminoid turfs and tundra. Macrophyllous forbs - characteristic plants of subantarctic islands - are common throughout. Most taxa have highly restricted pollen dispersal, largely due to the short stature of the vegetation and the high proportion of insect-pollinated species. Percentages of pollen or spores of the dominant taxa have a significant positive correlation with the percent vegetation cover of the corresponding species, the exceptions being the widespread ferns Polystichum vestitum and Blechnum spp., and the ubiquitous macrophyllous forb, Bulbinella rossii. The relationship between the vegetation cover of a given taxon and its pollen representation was usually not strong enough to give confidence in a quantitative reconstruction based on pollen frequency alone. However, the broad vegetation groupings have characteristic pollen and spore spectra clearly related to the abundance of their dominant plant species. Detrended correspondence analysis of the pollen spectra grouped most sites according to their source vegetation type and generated a pattern similar to that of vegetation data analysed in a similar fashion in previous studies of the island. This study, together with recent work on Auckland Island pollen and spore representation, has resulted in a combined modern palynological data base of more than 100 sites for the New Zealand subantarctic islands.},

The upper slopes of the catchment were almost entirely clad in Podocarpus and Phyllocladus dominant conifer/broad-leaved forest and the valley floor in Prumnopitys taxifolia for most of the Holocene, despite occasional forest fires in the region. Nothofagus forest spread into the wetter, mountainous region west of the Awatere valley at around c. 6000 years B.P., but failed to establish more than scattered stands on the drier Inland Kaikoura Ranges. Widespread fire broke out in the early Polynesian era and between 750 and 600 years B.P. the Awatere catchment lost most of its forest cover, which was replaced by bracken, grass and scrub. There was a slight recovery of forest and scrub after 600 years B.P. when burning frequency lessened. Increased burning, grazing, and introduction of exotic weeds accompanied the penetration of the region by European pastoralists in the 1860s. The post-1960 era is clearly indicated by the upsurge of Echium vulgare and Pinus spp. The Winterton bog has a finely balanced water budget, and it may have been initiated by changes in the seasonality of rainfall in the mid-Holocene.},

Low forest and scrub covers the lowland areas of the islands, with maritime tussock and herbfield associations on exposed coasts. With increasing altitude low scrub and shrubland-grassland predominate and, above 300 m altitude, tussock grassland and fellfield. Tall, wind-pollinated species do not occur on the island, and pollen deposition is thus largely local. The broad vegetation communities are clearly recognisable by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of the pollen data. Although percentage cover of the major plant taxa correlates significantly in most cases with pollen percentages, reliable quantitative inferences are not possible because of the high variability. Pollen types derived from Australia and the New Zealand mainland are consistently represented in the pollen rain, averaging 0.9\% and not exceeding 5\%. Comparison by DCA of fossil samples from a Holocene peat core with the modern data set demonstrate a close resemblance between modern and fossil samples. This survey shows that when tall wind-pollinated trees are excluded, low-growing vegetation with poorly dispersed pollen can be accurately characterised by its pollen rain.},

Dracophyllum scrub is the main cover from sea level to 200 m, above which tussock grassland, macrophyllous forbs and tundra dominate. Seven peat profiles from sea level to the tundra zone provide an elevational transect for pollen and charcoal records spanning the last 500 years. Scrub density was relatively low between 200 and 400 cal yrs BP, possibly due to Little Ice Age cooling, but had recovered by the time Europeans discovered the island in AD 1810. Burning and grazing during a brief farming episode (AD 1895\textendash 1931) severely reduced scrub and palatable grasses and forbs. Vegetation recovery is now well advanced following cessation of farming and the later elimination of all feral grazing animals, cats and rats. Climates were cool in the southwest Pacific during the farming period, and since AD 1970 the island has warmed by c. 0{$\cdot$}5\textdegree C. However, there has been no upwards movement of the scrubline despite vigorous regeneration of scrub at lower altitudes. The island's cloudy, highly oceanic climate appears to offset increasing summer warmth, and scrubline is likely to rise only if clearer and less windy, as well as warmer, summers eventuate.},

Similarity between the two data sets indicates that large herbivores were not required to maintain these taxa in the primeval landscape. * 3Fine spatial resolution pollen data from small hollows in Europe and eastern USA were also reviewed. Data from moss polsters show that percentage arboreal pollen is a reliable indicator of canopy openness in theses sites. The palaeoecological data demonstrate that open canopy forest has only ever been maintained by human exploitation. * 4Large herbivores in Europe do not therefore appear to have maintained an open landscape in primeval times although evidence suggests that they would have influenced the species composition of the forest canopy. * 5It is proposed that data sources other than pollen should be explored as proxies for past forest structure to test this hypothesis more thoroughly.},

  abstract = {Wetland conservation and management are generally only based on present-day studies, without integrating historical considerations. However, wetlands contain palaeoecological archives that can provide accurate records of their own history. Our study aims at reconciling this paradox in the central French Alps, by reconstructing the past wetland diversity/richness and the controls of Holocene hydroseral dynamics, and by discussing on this historical basis their conservation, management and restoration. Previously published data, complemented by the palaeoecological study of a sedge mire, reveal three main stages in the regional hydroseral succession: initial aquatic plant communities (Nymphaea alba, Nuphar cf. lutea, Menyanthes trifoliata), carrs (Alnus glutinosa/incana, Salix spp., Thelypteris palustris), then sedge meadows (Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Lythrum salicaria\ldots ). This dynamic comprises (1) a classical evolution from open water bodies to treed wet communities, controlled by the relationships between sedimentation processes and climate, and (2) an unexpected return to herbaceous wet habitats mainly triggered by Subatlantic human-induced managements. Such recent changes induced in the studied region the decline of Alnus cf. glutinosa, the disappearance of Thelypteris palustris, and the extinction of the carr communities they constituted. The historically-based assessment of community naturalness and resilience appears critical for defining conservation priorities, refining management actions, and identifying baseline conditions for restoration initiatives. The main implications of our results are to reinforce conservation measures on the less impacted habitats and to increase the diversity/richness of isolated lowland mires, notably by restoring alder communities in some of them.},

Knowledge about the dynamics of alder swamp woodlands is crucial for the conservation and management of this vegetation. Our studied site, Rambj\o ra, in western Norway encompasses the Rambj\o ra Landscape Protected Area. We combined information from three sources\textemdash recent alder swamp woodland ecology, vegetation history, and agricultural history\textemdash to reveal the long-term vegetation dynamics of Rambj\o ra in relation to land-use. Dynamic changes in the predominance of forest or semi-natural grassland over 2800years, concurrent with varying anthropogenic disturbances are inferred. At the investigated site, alder swamp woodland developed after forest clearance and changes in the water balance. The abundance of alder swamp woodlands have varied through time, increasing with low-impact land-use and declining with intensified use or abandonment. The highest biodiversity is found in periods with grazing, hay mowing, and probably fodder and fire wood collection. This indicates that agricultural practices of moderate intensity (grazing and hay cutting) should be part of the future management in order to maintain the biodiversity and meet the objective of the protection of Rambj\o ra. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining vegetation surveys, pollen records, and land-use history to provide a long-term perspective on vegetation development, and in our case also as an aid when establishing conservation strategies. Our findings need to be considered in future conservation and restoration of ecosystems with alder swamp woodlands.},

A phase of Nothofagus Blume forest dominance, during which fires were extensive, is dated to the late glacial, although the radiocarbon chronology is problematical and a 'last glacial maximum' age seems more likely. At other times the vegetation cover was primarily warm temperate conifer-angiosperm forest, which probably persisted up to the human era. Thus, although the composition of forest changed significantly at times, there is no evidence for substantial loss of forest. Similarly, conclusive evidence is lacking for any taxa extending their present latitudinal ranges during the last glacial, assuming the Halocarpus Quinn and Nothofagus Blume pollen identified are from the Northland species of these genera. The palaeoclimatic implications are that the last glacial temperature depression in Northland may have been less than in the rest of New Zealand, although the 'last glacial maximum' was probably very dry. Nothofagus fusca type pollen is tentatively assigned to N. truncata Ckn. on the basis of aperture counts as well as ecological and biogeographical considerations. Its expansion, evidently in association with fire, and its postglacial contraction, are consistent with its scattered distribution in Northland today. It may possibly have survived in the region as an opportunist species responding to periodic disturbances in the predominantly conifer-angiosperm forest cover. Agathis australis Salisb. was prominent in Northland for most of the last 30,000 years, except during the period of Nothofagus dominance (the 'last glacial maximum'?). Its postglacial history at this site and at others from Northland indicate expanding populations after around 8000 years ago, with no major contraction until the human era. A. australis appears to have been especially susceptible to both natural and anthropogenic fires.}

  abstract = {This paper considers the implications of a range of global-mean sea-level rise and socio-economic scenarios on: (1) changes in flooding by storm surges; and (2) potential losses of coastal wetlands through the 21st century. These scenarios are derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Four different storylines are analysed: the A1FI, A2, B1 and B2 `worlds'. The climate scenarios are derived from the HadCM3 climate model driven by the SRES emission scenarios. The SRES scenarios for global-mean sea-level rise range from 22cm (B1 world) to 34cm (A1FI world) by the 2080s, relative to 1990. All other climate factors, including storm characteristics, are assumed to remain constant in the long term. Population and GDP scenarios are downscaled from the SRES regional analyses supplemented with other relevant scenarios for each impact analysis. The flood model predicts that about 10 million people/year experienced coastal flooding due to surges in 1990. The incidence of flooding will change without sea-level rise, but these changes are strongly controlled by assumptions on protection. Assuming that defence standards improve with growth in GDP/capita (lagged by 30 years), flood incidence increases in all four cases to the 2020s due to the growing exposed population. Then to the 2080s, the incidence of flooding declined significantly to {$\leqslant$}5 million people/ year in the B2 world, {$\leqslant$}2 million people/year in the B1 world and {$\leqslant$}1 million people/year in the A1FI world due to improving defence standards. In contrast, flood incidence continues to increase in the A2 world to the 2050s, and in the 2080s it is still 18\textendash 30 million people/year. This reflects the greater exposure and more limited adaptive capacity of the A2 world, compared to the other SRES storylines. Sea-level rise increases the flood impacts in all cases although significant impacts are not apparent until the 2080s when the additional people flooded are 7\textendash 10 million, 29\textendash 50 million, 2\textendash 3 million and 16\textendash 27 million people/year under the A1FI, A2, B1 and B2 worlds, respectively. Hence, the A2 world also experiences the highest increase in the incidence of flooding. This is true under all the realistic scenario combinations that were considered demonstrating that socio-economic factors can greatly influence vulnerability to sea-level rise. The trends of the results also suggest that flood impacts due to sea-level rise could become much more severe through the 22nd century in all cases, especially in the A1FI world. Note that impacts using a climate model with a higher climate sensitivity would produce larger impacts than HadCM3. Coastal wetlands will be lost due to sea-level rise in all world futures with 5\textendash 20\% losses by the 2080s in the A1FI world. However, these losses are relatively small compared to the potential for direct and indirect human destruction. Thus, the difference in environmental attitudes between the A1/A2 worlds and the B1/B2 worlds would seem to have more important implications for the future of coastal wetlands, than the magnitude of the sea-level rise scenarios during the 21st Century. These results should be seen as broad analysis of the sensitivity of the coastal system to the HadCM3 SRES global-mean sea-level rise scenarios. While these impact estimates are only for one climate model, for both impact factors they stress the importance of socio-economic conditions and other non-climate factors as a fundamental control on the magnitude of impacts both with and without sea-level rise. The A2 world experiences the largest impacts during the 21st century, while the B1 world has the smallest impacts, with the differences more reflecting socio-economic factors than climate change. This suggests that the role of development pathways in influencing the impacts of climate change needs to be given more attention.},

In particular, noticeable effect has been attained in the field of microbial ecology, where new experimental approaches provided in-depth assessments of the composition, functions and dynamic changes of complex microbial communities. Because even a single high-throughput experiment produces large amount of data, powerful statistical techniques of multivariate analysis are well suited to analyse and interpret these data sets. Many different multivariate techniques are available, and often it is not clear which method should be applied to a particular data set. In this review, we describe and compare the most widely used multivariate statistical techniques including exploratory, interpretive and discriminatory procedures. We consider several important limitations and assumptions of these methods, and we present examples of how these approaches have been utilized in recent studies to provide insight into the ecology of the microbial world. Finally, we offer suggestions for the selection of appropriate methods based on the research question and data set structure.},

  abstract = {Community ecological theory may play an important role in the development of a science of restoration ecology. Not only will the practice of restoration benefit from an increased focus on theory, but basic research in community ecology will also benefit. We pose several major thematic questions that are relevant to restoration from the perspective of community ecological theory and, for each, identify specific areas that are in critical need of further research to advance the science of restoration ecology. We ask, what are appropriate restoration endpoints from a community ecology perspective? The problem of measuring restoration at the community level, particularly given the high amount of variability inherent in most natural communities, is not easy, and may require a focus on restoration of community function (e.g., trophic structure) rather than a focus on the restoration of particular species. We ask, what are the benefits and limitations of using species composition or biodiversity measures as endpoints in restoration ecology? Since reestablishing all native species may rarely be possible, research is needed on the relationship between species richness and community stability of restored sites and on functional redundancy among species in regional colonist ``pools.'' Efforts targeted at restoring system function must take into account the role of individual species, particularly if some species play a disproportionate role in processing material or are strong interactors. We ask, is restoration of habitat a sufficient approach to reestablish species and function? Many untested assumptions concerning the relationship between physical habitat structure and restoration ecology are being made in practical restoration efforts. We need rigorous testing of these assumptions, particularly to determine how generally they apply to different taxa and habitats. We ask, to what extent can empirical and theoretical work on community succession and dispersal contribute to restoration ecology? We distinguish systems in which succession theory may be broadly applicable from those in which it is probably not. If community development is highly predictable, it may be feasible to manipulate natural succession processes to accelerate restoration. We close by stressing that the science of restoration ecology is so intertwined with basic ecological theory that practical restoration efforts should rely heavily on what is known from theoretical and empirical research on how communities develop and are structured over time.},

  abstract = {Shifting baseline syndrome (SBS) is often referred to as a key issue for conservation, yet there is little evidence for its existence. The presence of SBS could influence the validity of participatory monitoring, local ecological knowledge, community based conservation, and conservation education. We outline two forms of SBS: (1) generational amnesia, where knowledge extinction occurs because younger generations are not aware of past biological conditions and (2) personal amnesia, where knowledge extinction occurs as individuals forget their own experience. Two conditions are essential to the identification of SBS: (1) biological change must be present in the system and (2) any perceived changes must be consistent with the biological data. If age or experience-related differences in perception are then found, generational amnesia may be occurring. Alternately, if individuals believe current conditions also occurred in the past, personal amnesia may be occurring. Previous studies have not fully addressed these conditions, and hence cannot provide indisputable evidence for the existence of SBS. We present three case studies to examine these issues, which demonstrate both forms of SBS. Shifting baseline syndrome is no longer a cautionary tale, but instead is a real problem for those using human perceptions of change to inform conservation policy-making or management.},

  abstract = {Gauging whether or when a population, species, or community recovers from an environmental accident or disturbance, such as an oil spill or forest fire, is complicated by environmental variation in time and space, and therefore depends on the assumptions one makes about equilibrium. These ecological assumptions about equilibrium affect how one designs and interprets studies to assess recovery from environmental accidents or disturbances. We use examples from studies conducted following the Exxon Valdez oil spill to illustrate several approaches to assessing recovery and their sensitivity to the form of equilibrium one assumes. Baseline study designs, which compare levels of a resource after the disturbance to pre-disturbance levels for impact data only, are generally inadequate because they rest on the unrealistic assumption of steady-state equilibrium. Since data for the impact area only are used, recovery and temporal variation are confounded. Unlike baseline designs, before\textendash after control\textendash impact (BACI) designs use impact and reference data, and relax this sensitivity by incorporating both temporal and spatial variation. Studies that compare impacted with reference areas in a single year following the disturbance assume spatial equilibrium and therefore may confound recovery with systematic spatial differences between the areas. Sampling and analytical strategies such as stratified random sampling or the use of environmental measures as covariates may lessen the sensitivity to this assumption. Multiyear studies that include comparisons between impacted and reference areas or that sample areas along a gradient of disturbance rest on the more realistic assumption of dynamic equilibrium. Understanding the underlying assumptions and how they relate to the approach one uses must be part of assessing the recovery of biological resources from an environmental accident. Because the dynamics of different populations, species, and communities and the environments they occupy vary and exhibit different dependencies on the scale of disturbance (and the scale of analysis), there is no single ``best'' approach to assessing recovery. Discussions about recovery should include an explicit and honest consideration of the underlying ecological assumptions, the likelihood that they hold in the system being studied, and the consequences if the assumptions are violated.},

They may be used as correction factors for Late Quaternary pollen spectra\textemdash subject to certain caveats. The use of R-values implies a particular mathematical model, which is discussed in depth. Various problems are shown to arise; three computer-based statistical approaches are described in an attempt to overcome these problems. The first uses cluster and principal component analyses to group modern sites according to ``R-spectra'' and to detect departures from the model. The other two approaches obtain maximum likelihood estimates of (a) R-values and (b) representation coefficients and ``background'' coefficients in a model that attempts to allow for long-distance transport. Each approach is illustrated by application to Livingstone's surface pollen and forest-inventory data from southeast Canada. It is shown how long-distance Quercus (oak) pollen inflates R-values for oak at sites where oak trees are scarce. Livingstone's average R-values for oak was much too high since it was heavily biased by these sites. Maximum likelihood estimation gave a more realistic overall figure. Background oak pollen values estimated via the third approach are close to total oak pollen percentage at many sites, i.e. the method ascribes much of the incoming oak pollen to non-local sources. It is concluded that the three approaches together will make it possible to avoid the worst statistical problems associated with R-values, although vegetational heterogeneity and differential pollen transport will continue to limit achievable precision in the reconstruction of vegetation.},

  abstract = {Biological assessments of forest systems often involve a single ground-invertebrate sampling method that may ignore the biological component of the non-sampled canopy. Pitfall trapping for ground-active arthropods is a widely implemented technique for biological assessment in forested and open habitats. Although much evidence highlights the biases of pitfall trapping, this evidence typically comes from open-habitat crop and grassland systems. In forest systems where much of the biodiversity is found within the above-ground structure, management recommendations based solely on ground sampling may not represent the diversity within the three dimensional forest habitat. We provide evidence from combined ground and canopy sampling of three major forest types within the study region. We use canopy insecticide fogging to compare with more traditional ground-based pitfall trapping, and use spiders as a comparative species-rich biota that is able to colonise most terrestrial habitats and is strongly affected by changes in environmental condition. We identified 3933 spiders from 109 species from the 18 forest patches sampled. Both types of sampling defined differences in community composition between forest types in a similar manner; hence, either method could be used to evaluate differences or test management regimes in well-replicated experiments of forest type. However, the association in community composition between ground and canopy assemblages at the individual site-based level was weak; we found low correlation between the two data sets indicating that surrogacy between methods was not supported at this level. Furthermore, disparities in spider habitat association, body size, hunting guild and vertical stratification of spider families indicates that where detailed species and family-based information is required, or if inventorying is necessary, then multiple targeted surveys are essential.},

Dacrydium cupressinum, Podocarpus spicatus, P. ferrugineus, Pinus, Nothofagus fusca type, N. menziesii, and the tree fern Cyathea smithii) growing in montane and lowland forests. Two other dominant components of the montane forest at Ajax Hill, Weinmannia racemosa and Metrosideros umbellata, are scarcely recorded.

Libocedrus and Podocarpus nivalis are consistently underrepresented. P. hallii is well represented locally but its pollen is scarcely recorded more than 50 m from the parent trees.

Other surface pollen studies have established that there is a quantitative relationship between the pollen percentages of the major taxa and their relative importance in the vegetation. Maps based on surface pollen data reflect patterns of species abundance over a range of spatial scales (Fig. 1).

However, recent progress towards a theoretical synthesis now provides a guiding framework for organizing and integrating all primary data and methods for spatiotemporal assemblage-level inference in ecology. In this paper, we describe how recent theoretical developments can provide an organizing paradigm for linking advances in data collection and methodological frameworks across disparate ecological sub-disciplines and across large spatial and temporal scales. First, we summarize the set of fundamental processes that determine change in multispecies assemblages across spatial and temporal scales by reviewing recent theoretical syntheses of community ecology. Second, we review recent advances in data and methods across the main sub-disciplines concerned with ecological inference across large spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, and organize them based on the primary fundamental processes they include, rather than the spatiotemporal scale of their inferences. Finally, we highlight how iteratively focusing on only one fundamental process at a time, but combining all relevant spatiotemporal data and methods, may reduce the conceptual challenges to integration among ecological sub-disciplines. Moreover, we discuss a number of avenues for decreasing the practical barriers to integration among data and methods. We aim to reconcile the recent convergence of decades of thinking in community ecology and macroecology theory with the rapid progress in spatiotemporal approaches for assemblage-level inference, at a time where a robust understanding of spatiotemporal change in ecological assemblages is more crucial than ever to conserve biodiversity.},

The application of field-based tools over large regions can be prohibitively expensive; however, land cover data may provide a surrogate for intensive assessments, enabling rapid and cost-effective evaluation of wetlands throughout whole regions. Our goal was to determine if land cover data could be used to estimate the biotic integrity of wetlands in Alberta's Beaverhills watershed. Biotic integrity was measured using both plant- and bird-based indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) in 45 wetlands. Land cover data were extracted from seven nested landscape extents (100\textendash 3,000 m radii) and used to model IBI scores. Strong, significant predictions of IBI scores were achieved using land cover data from every spatial extent, even after factoring out the influence of location to address the spatial autocorrelation of land cover classes. Plant-based IBI scores were best predicted using data from 100 m buffers and bird-based IBI scores were best predicted using data extracted from 500 m buffers. Road cover or density and measures of the proportion of disturbed land were consistent predictors of IBI score, suggesting their universal importance to plant and bird communities. Simplified models using the proportion of undisturbed land were less accurate than more detailed models (reductions in r2 of 0.31\textendash 0.32). Regardless of the level of detail in land cover classification, our results emphasize the need to optimize landscape extent for the taxonomic group of interest: an issue that is typically poorly articulated in studies reporting on the development of GIS-based assessment methods. Our results also highlight the need to calibrate models in test areas before scaling up, to ensure predictive accuracy.},

Another field of research is uncovering generic empirical indicators of the proximity to such critical thresholds.

Regression results using vegetation samples from various sized areas around each lake for Fagus grandifolia (Ehrh.) and Tsuga canadensis (Carr.), are consistent with my initial design of using vegetation data for the single township in which a lake was found to compute the regression results. Pollen-tree correction factors from pre-settlement and modern data were compared for all major pollen types. Notable differences were found between pre-settlement data and modern data sets for Wisconsin in Betula spp, T. canadensis, and Quercus spp. Little difference was observed in the fit of the regressions for these data sets. Estimations of pre-settlement relative tree frequencies, derived from the application of modern correction factors on pre-settlement pollen frequencies, were compared to measurements of pre-settlement vegetation. The reconstruction of pre-settlement vegetation was incongruous with measurements of pre-settlement tree frequencies. It is unclear, given minor differences in the data sources for modern and pre-settlement data, whether the observed differences in regression results are artifacts of the data sets, or reflect differences in pollen-tree representation between the two time periods sampled. Regardless, the error associated with prediction of tree frequencies from pollen frequencies is shown here to preclude any assurance of accuracy with normal pollen count levels.},

  abstract = {Regime shifts are often used to describe sharp changes between two or more ecological states, each characterized by their own dynamics, stochastic fluctuations, or cycles. Ecological theory indicates they can occur either as a result of an abrupt environmental forcing (extrinsic regime shift), or be indicative of complex responses to local-scale dynamics and thresholds (intrinsic regime shift). One important area of ecological research is to develop quantitative tools to analyze regime shifts, but there are few studies that have applied these methods to the long-term ecological record. In this study, we introduce a framework to investigate regime shifts in diatom assemblages and mangrove ecosystem dynamics in a coastal lagoon from the Gal\'apagos Islands over the past 2600 years. The framework integrates a set of established statistical methodologies for investigating regime shift dynamics in long-term ecological records. We use these methods to (1) identify the presence of regime shifts; (2) test for a series of hypothetical relationships (i.e., linear through to threshold) between ecological response and environment using nonlinear regression; and (3) investigate the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics in response to environmental perturbations. The transitions in the diatoms closely track the sequence of disturbance, recovery, and habitat shifts that have occurred in the lagoon over the past 2600 years, demonstrating extrinsic responses to environmental forcing. In contrast, the shift from a mangrove- to a microbial mat-dominated system {$\sim$}945 cal yr BP provides potential evidence of an intrinsic regime shift. Our framework enables robust interpretations into the underlying dynamics of regime shifts in the paleoecological record and is widely applicable for investigating abrupt ecological changes in a range of systems.},

  abstract = {During the last decade Quaternary pollen analysis has developed towards improved pollen-taxonomical precision, automated pollen identification and more rigorous definition of pollen assemblage zones. There have been significant efforts to model the spatial representation of pollen records in lake sediments which is important for more precise interpretation of the pollen records in terms of past vegetation patterns. We review the difficulties in matching modelled post-glacial plant migration patterns with pollen-based palaeorecords and discuss the potential of DNA analysis of pollen to investigate the ancestry and past migration pathways of the plants. In population ecology there has been an acceleration of the widely advocated conceptual advance of pollen-analytical research from vaguely defined `environmental reconstructions' towards investigating more precisely defined ecological problems aligned with the current ecological theories. Examples of such research have included an increasing number of investigations about the ecological impacts of past disturbances, often integrating pollen records with other palaeoecological data. Such an approach has also been applied to incorporate a time perspective to the questions of ecosystem restoration, nature conservation and forest management. New lines of research are the use of pollen analysis to study long-term patterns of vegetation diversity, such as the role of glacial-age vegetation fragmentation as a cause of Amazonian rain forest diversity, and to investigate links between pollen richness and past plant diversity. Palaeoclimatological use of pollen records has become more quantitative and has included more precise and rigorous testing of pollen-climate calibration models with modern climate data. These tests show the approximate nature of the models and warn against a too straightforward climatic interpretation of the small-scale variation in reconstructions. Pollen-based climate reconstructions over the Late Glacial-early Holocene boundary have indicated that pollen-stratigraphical changes have been rapid with no evidence for response lags. This does not rule out the possibility of migrational disequilibrium, however, as the rapid changes may be mostly due to nonmigrational responses of existing vegetation. It is therefore difficult to assess whether the amplitude of reconstructed climate change reflects real climate change. Other outstanding problems remain the obscure relationship of pollen production and climate, the role of human impact and other nonclimatic factors, and nonanalogue situations.},

The complex, multidimensional nature of these data sets, the recognition of the enormous variation of communities and environments both in space and time, and the difficulties of dealing with these problems by the human mind, justify the use of multivariate statistical methods in palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography. Concepts and basic procedures of several commonly used multivariated statistical methods of palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography are reviewed in the wider context of quantitative community ecology and biogeography, basic assumptions about data structure and theoretical and practical limitations are discussed. The emphasis is on evaluation of binary similarity coefficients and two multivariate approaches: cluster analysis and ordination. Thirty-nine binary similarity coefficients are evaluated against nine criteria, Jaccard's coefficient of community is found most suitable as a similarity measure between samples under the conditions tested. Algorithmic procedures of cluster analysis, especially the agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis techniques, and indirect ordinations (particularly polar ordination, principal component analysis, principal coordinate analysis, correspondence analysis, detrended correspondence analysis, and nonmetric multidimensional scaling) are outlined and their applicability to palaeoecological and palaeobiogeographical data is discussed. Where the data are appropriate, an integration of cluster analysis and ordination is suggested to be applied to the same data.},

In this paper, we studied invertebrate communities in 63 river sites of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) sampled over 609thousandkm2. We identified important macroinvertebrate taxa of the component communities (i.e. annelids, crustaceans, mollusks and insects), and key geo-environmental factors that explained the total variance (BDTotal) of the communities at large spatial scale. We used the ``Species Contributions to Beta Diversity'' (SCBD) and ``Local Contributions to Beta Diversity'' (LCBD) approaches to partition total beta diversity (BDTotal), identified the important macroinvertebrate taxa (those with high SCBD indices), and estimated the uniqueness of sites in community composition (LCBD indices). SCBD indices showed which taxa were the most important in structuring the four component communities: there were 29 insect taxa, which mainly characterized the upstream sites, and 18 mollusk, 7 annelid and 6 crustacean taxa, which all represented the downstream sites. We used linear regression models to investigate the influence of geo-environmental factors and of component communities on LCBD indices. Our results showed great variation in composition within the LMB (BDTotal=0.80 on a 0-to-1 scale). Five sites of the main channel exhibited significant uniqueness (LCBD indices) in community composition. One of them was a hotspot location occupied by a community with exceptional taxonomic composition, which should be protected. Four other sites were degraded by human activity and in need of restoration. Multiple regressions indicated that the global LCBD indices are better explained by the environmental factors, i.e. water conductivity, river depth and Secchi depth (adjusted R2=0.26), than by the geographical factors. Among the component communities, mollusks' and insects' LCBDs were the determinants responsible for the variation in the global LCBD indices (adjusted R2=0.84). The uniqueness in community composition of the sites (i.e. LCBDs) that we estimated provides useful ecological information, which could be used to support restoration and conservation planning for the LMB.},

However, we argue that this approach is not yet fully developed because the pursuit of empirical evidence to underpin such theoretically grounded management continues in the absence of an objective probability framework. This has blurred the lines between intuitive logic (based on the elementary principles of probability) and extensional logic (based on assumption and belief) in this field. Lake ecosystems have provided much of the empirical evidence for ecological resilience theory. Here, a more rigorous logical approach is called for when translating this research into management decisions.},

The index, composed of 13 indicators related to wetland function, was tested in the field for scientific validity relative to an independent long-term monitoring data set, replicability of indicator scores by different investigators and the responses to the seasonality in wetland processes. Indicator values were based on a mixture of visual estimates and measurements using simple instruments or procedures and all data could be collected in the field in less than 3 h. There was a significant positive correlation between rankings of the condition of 10 wetlands based on an independent long-term monitoring data set and the wetland condition index. There were also highly significant positive correlations between indicator scores collected by different investigators. Indicator scores for physical factors and fringing vegetation did not differ between autumn and winter, but winter rainfall had a significant impact on aquatic vegetation and water quality indicators.

  abstract = {An important component of the biological assessment of stream condition is an evaluation of the direct or indirect effects of human activities or disturbances. The concept of a ``reference condition'' is increasingly used to describe the standard or benchmark against which current condition is compared. Many individual nations, and the European Union as a whole, have codified the concept of reference condition in legislation aimed at protecting and improving the ecological condition of streams. However, the phrase ``reference condition'' has many meanings in a variety of contexts. One of the primary purposes of this paper is to bring some consistency to the use of the term. We argue the need for a ``reference condition'' term that is reserved for referring to the ``naturalness'' of the biota (structure and function) and that naturalness implies the absence of significant human disturbance or alteration. To avoid the confusion that arises when alternative definitions of reference condition are used, we propose that the original concept of reference condition be preserved in this modified form of the term: ``reference condition for biological integrity,'' or RC(BI). We further urge that these specific terms be used to refer to the concepts and methods used in individual bioassessments to characterize the expected condition to which current conditions are compared: ``minimally disturbed condition'' (MDC); ``historical condition'' (HC); ``least disturbed condition'' (LDC); and ``best attainable condition'' (BAC). We argue that each of these concepts can be narrowly defined, and each implies specific methods for estimating expectations. We also describe current methods by which these expectations are estimated including: the reference-site approach (condition at minimally or least-disturbed sites); best professional judgment; interpretation of historical condition; extrapolation of empirical models; and evaluation of ambient distributions. Because different assumptions about what constitutes reference condition will have important effects on the final classification of streams into condition classes, we urge that bioassessments be consistent in describing the definitions and methods used to set expectations.},

POLLSCAPE simulations demonstrate that (1) regional vegetation composition can be used to predict background pollen at and beyond the relevant source area of pollen for given-sized basins, (2) LOVE with the LRA framework provides a robust and accurate estimate of local vegetation composition much better than vegetation reconstruction using pollen percentages alone and (3) although the relevant source area of pollen is difficult to estimate particularly in past landscapes, a proposed method using backward modelling of LOVE is effective to estimate the relevant source area in landscapes of unknown vegetation patchiness and heterogeneity. Thus, the LRA will also be useful to estimate indirectly changes in spatial structure of past vegetation and landscape caused by natural and anthropogenic forcing.},

  abstract = {1 According to the Prentice-Sugita model, pollen loading (PL) is linearly related to the distance-weighted plant abundance (DWPA) surrounding a sedimentary basin. Since source trees of pollen far away from a basin have much less influence on pollen representation than source trees near a basin, the correlation between PL and DWPA should approach an asymptote as the vegetation sampling area increases. The `relevant source area' for pollen can be defined as the area beyond which the correlation does not improve. 2 A simulation experiment using patchy vegetation landscapes illustrates this principle, demonstrating that \$r\^2\$ and likelihood function scores do not improve when vegetation sampling increases beyond certain distances. This suggests that very little additional information on the pollen-plant abundance relationship will be gained by a vegetation survey beyond the `relevant' distance when data are collected from regions of similar vegetation type and spatial pattern. 3 The `relevant' source area for pollen in lakes in the simulated landscapes is within 50-100 m from the lake edge for forest hollows (radius of hollow \$R = 2 m\$), 300-400 m for small lakes (\$R = 50 m\$), and 600-800 m for medium size lakes \$(R = 250 m\$). Although only about 30-45\% of total pollen loading comes from within these distances, the model demonstrates that when the background pollen is consistent, this proportion is adequate to reflect local vegetation composition. 4 The simulation results show that pollen data from large lakes (\$R = 750 m\$) show little site-to-site variation, especially for a species that grows in small patches (radii of 80 m in the simulated landscape). Linear regression and maximum likelihood methods therefore do not provide accurate estimations of pollen productivity and background pollen loading. Vegetation may appear homogeneous even when the actual pattern of vegetation is heterogeneous and patchy, depending on the size of lake relative to the size of patches. 5 The pollen-plant abundance data should be collected from regions with similar forest composition to determine the `relevant' source area and the parameters of a linear relationship between PL and DWPA. Otherwise, either the linear regression or maximum likelihood methods provide inaccurate estimates of the relevant source area and parameters even when the simulation data with no sampling and counting errors are used.},

This approach ignores the considerable biodiversity and functional values of small aquatic organisms. The aim of this study was to assess the correspondence between landscape-based indices of wetland condition and the community composition of both aquatic invertebrates and diatoms across a broad range of wetlands in the West Coast region of New Zealand. Aquatic invertebrates and diatoms were sampled from 29 lowland wetlands subject to varying degrees of catchment modification. Wetland condition was assessed independently using two methods: a field-based method to give the Wetland Condition Index, and a GIS-based method that gave an Index of Ecological Integrity. Strong relationships existed between community composition and pH, so we partitioned the community data into groups according to wetland pH. We found only weak relationships between wetland condition scores and invertebrate and diatom communities within each pH group. In most cases, data describing the nutrient status of the water had the strongest influence on invertebrate and diatom communities. Lack of strong associations between measured wetland condition indices and either diatom or invertebrate community composition suggests that neither index was dominated by variables directly influencing the aquatic component of wetland biota. The challenges now are to identify the critical variables, and to develop complementary wetland scoring systems that better reflect the status of small aquatic organisms.},

  abstract = {Applied historical ecology is the use of historical knowledge in the management of ecosystems. Historical perspectives increase our understanding of the dynamic nature of landscapes and provide a frame of reference for assessing modern patterns and processes. Historical records, however, are often too brief or fragmentary to be useful, or they are not obtainable for the process or structure of interest. Even where long historical time series can be assembled, selection of appropriate reference conditions may be complicated by the past influence of humans and the many potential reference conditions encompassed by nonequilibrium dynamics. These complications, however, do not lessen the value of history; rather they underscore the need for multiple, comparative histories from many locations for evaluating both cultural and natural causes of variability, as well as for characterizing the overall dynamical properties of ecosystems. Historical knowledge may not simplify the task of setting management goals and making decisions, but 20th century trends, such as increasingly severe wildfires, suggest that disregarding history can be perilous. We describe examples from our research in the southwestern United States to illustrate some of the values and limitations of applied historical ecology. Paleoecological data from packrat middens and other natural archives have been useful for defining baseline conditions of vegetation communities, determining histories and rates of species range expansions and contractions, and discriminating between natural and cultural causes of environmental change. We describe a montane grassland restoration project in northern New Mexico that was justified and guided by an historical sequence of aerial photographs showing progressive tree invasion during the 20th century. Likewise, fire scar chronologies have been widely used to justify and guide fuel reduction and natural fire reintroduction in forests. A southwestern network of fire histories illustrates the power of aggregating historical time series across spatial scales. Regional fire patterns evident in these aggregations point to the key role of interannual lags in responses of fuels and fire regimes to the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (wet/dry cycles), with important implications for long-range fire hazard forecasting. These examples of applied historical ecology emphasize that detection and explanation of historical trends and variability are essential to informed management.},

Because of implicit restrictions, however, palynology fails to reconstruct in detail the distributional patterns and whether monospecific or mixed forests prevailed. Here we test the hypothesis that the distributional patterns of Pinus and Betula were largely determined by substrate. Location\hspace{0.6em} Fifteen sites in north-east Germany. Methods\hspace{0.6em} As pollen data reflect the abundance of taxa around a sample site, our hypothesis implies that the abundance of e.g. Pinus pollen should reflect the abundance of substrate types that are favoured by Pinus. (In order to differentiate clearly between taxa and pollen types, the latter are displayed in small capitals.) We analysed the percentage of Pinus and Betula pollen from an interval in the Aller\o d, and their relationship to the present-day proportion of the two dominant substrate types (sand and boulder clay). The substrate proportion was determined in rings from 1 to 50~km around all sites, using four distance-weighting functions. Results\hspace{0.6em} Pollen percentages of Pinus are linearly related to the proportion of sand, and Betula percentages to the proportion of boulder clay. The highest coefficients of determination (r2~=~0.89 and 0.91, respectively) were observed for radii of c. 30~km, with distance weighting by 1 and 1/d. Main conclusions\hspace{0.6em} The present-day distributional pattern of substrate types strongly indicates the distributional pattern of Pinus and Betula in north-east Germany in the Aller\o d. Assuming that the pattern of substrates remained broadly constant, Pinus dominated on sand and Betula on boulder clay. Our new method thus enables us to refine significantly the reconstruction of habitat characteristics and distributional patterns of taxa in the Lateglacial and Holocene, independent of their present-day ecological amplitudes. The good performance of the distance-weighting functions 1 and 1/d indicates that the pollen source area of a site has rather discrete boundaries determined by convective air movements during daytime. Within these boundaries, pollen is evenly distributed over various distances. This implies that light pollen types are transported further than predicted by Sutton's equation on particle dispersal.},

Using surface sediment samples from small and medium sized, closed and near circular lakes from lowland Central Europe, we tested the validity of three pollen dispersal models by comparing empirical pollen data from each lake with simulated pollen data derived from applying various pollen dispersal models to vegetation data from rings situated up to 100 km from each site. Pollen assemblages simulated with a Lagrangian stochastic (LS) model best fit real pollen assemblages, simulations with the commonly used Prentice model on pollen dispersal underestimated the amount of pollen arriving from distances larger than 10 km and overestimated the differences in dispersal distances between lighter (Pinus) and heavier (Fagus, Picea) pollen grains. The LS model appeared to provide more appropriate simulations. Pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) calculated for the data set showed that the choice of the dispersal model has great impact on the results. If derived with the Prentice model, PPEs for Fagus and Picea are three times higher than with the LS model. Studies on pollen productivities thus need to consider the apparent limitations of the Prentice model. We suggest an alternative approach, which uses simulations instead of the extended R-value model, to calculate PPEs. The approach is flexible in the use of dispersal functions and produced consistent results for two independent data sets from small and medium sized lakes.},

  abstract = {`Tipping points' in the Earth system are characterised by a nonlinear response to gradual forcing, and may have severe and wide-ranging impacts. Many abrupt events result from simple underlying system dynamics termed `critical transitions' or `bifurcations'. One of the best ways to identify and potentially predict threshold behaviour in the climate system is through analysis of natural (`palaeo') archives. Specifically, on the approach to a tipping point, early warning signals can be detected as characteristic fluctuations in a time series as a system loses stability. Testing whether these early warning signals can be detected in highly complex real systems is a key challenge, since much work is either theoretical or only tested with simple models. This is particularly problematic in palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironmental records with low resolution, non-equidistant data, which can limit accurate analysis. Here, a range of different datasets are examined to explore generic rules that can be used to detect such dramatic events. A number of key criteria are identified to be necessary for the reliable identification of early warning signals in natural archives, most crucially, the need for a low-noise record of sufficient data length, resolution and accuracy. A deeper understanding of the underlying system dynamics is required to inform the development of more robust system-specific indicators, or to indicate the temporal resolution required, given a known forcing. This review demonstrates that time series precursors from natural archives provide a powerful means of forewarning tipping points within the Earth System.},

Here we report a multi-proxy study from Stewart Island and southern Fiordland, New Zealand (46\textendash 47\textdegree S) reconstructing Holocene changes at the northern limit of westerly airflow. Increased minerogenic input and a pronounced shift in cool-loving vegetation around 5500 years ago is consistent with the establishment of westerly airflow at this latitude in the southwest Pacific. In marked contrast, stronger winds are reported further south over the subantarctic Auckland (50\textdegree S) and Campbell (52\textdegree S) Islands from 8000 years ago. Intriguingly, reconstructions from the east Pacific suggest a weakening of core westerly airflow after 8500 years ago, but an expansion along the northern limits sometime after 5500 years ago. Our results suggest similar atmospheric circulation changes have been experienced in the Pacific since 5500 years ago, but indicate an expanded network of sites is needed to comprehensively test the driver(s) and impact(s) of Holocene mid-latitude westerly winds across the Southern Hemisphere.},

We propose four backward selection approaches, based on permutation testing, that differ in whether coefficient size is used or not in ranking the RVs. These methods are expected to give a more robust result than the use of a straightforward cut-off value for coefficient size. Performance of all methods is demonstrated in a simulation study using realistic data. The permutation testing approach that uses information on coefficient size of RVs speeds up the algorithm without affecting its performance. This most successful permutation testing approach removes roughly 95 \% of the RVs that are unaffected by the treatment irrespective of the characteristics of the data set and, in the simulations, correctly identifies up to 97 \% of RVs affected by the treatment.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Regime shifts are often used to describe sharp changes between two or more ecological states, each characterized by their own dynamics, stochastic fluctuations, or cycles. Ecological theory indicates they can occur either as a result of an abrupt environmental forcing (extrinsic regime shift), or be indicative of complex responses to local-scale dynamics and thresholds (intrinsic regime shift). One important area of ecological research is to develop quantitative tools to analyze regime shifts, but there are few studies that have applied these methods to the long-term ecological record. In this study, we introduce a framework to investigate regime shifts in diatom assemblages and mangrove ecosystem dynamics in a coastal lagoon from the Gal\'apagos Islands over the past 2600 years. The framework integrates a set of established statistical methodologies for investigating regime shift dynamics in long-term ecological records. We use these methods to (1) identify the presence of regime shifts; (2) test for a series of hypothetical relationships (i.e., linear through to threshold) between ecological response and environment using nonlinear regression; and (3) investigate the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics in response to environmental perturbations. The transitions in the diatoms closely track the sequence of disturbance, recovery, and habitat shifts that have occurred in the lagoon over the past 2600 years, demonstrating extrinsic responses to environmental forcing. In contrast, the shift from a mangrove- to a microbial mat-dominated system {$\sim$}945 cal yr BP provides potential evidence of an intrinsic regime shift. Our framework enables robust interpretations into the underlying dynamics of regime shifts in the paleoecological record and is widely applicable for investigating abrupt ecological changes in a range of systems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Sediments deposited in fen carr environments are frequently used in pollen-based reconstructions of vegetation history, although few studies of modern pollen\textendash vegetation relationships in fen carr have been undertaken to aid the interpretation of fossil assemblages. It is often assumed that the wetland pollen signal will reflect the overall composition of the fen carr system although, given the closed canopy context, it may actually be dominated by local vegetation elements. This paper seeks to determine whether the vegetation heterogeneity within a modern fen carr is reflected in the pollen signal of the wetland taxa. Vegetation composition was recorded around a series of moss polster sample points at Calthorpe and Wheatfen, two areas of fen carr in the Norfolk Broadland, UK. The spatial interrelationship between the wetland components of the vegetation and their palynological equivalents in the moss polster pollen assemblages is explored through trend surfaces and a correlation based statistical test (the Mantel Test). The representation of the major vegetation components in the pollen record is highly variable. Values for Alnus glutinosa, a dominant canopy species, range from 5.3\% to 73\% of total land pollen (TLP) at Calthorpe and 2.5\textendash 61\% TLP at Wheatfen. In part, this variation reflects the enhanced input of pollen from dry land sources close to the wetland edge although the variation recorded at points equidistant from the dry land margin suggests that other processes are also influential. The strongest positive associations in the Mantel Test are for under-storey and ground flora elements that are poorly represented in the pollen record. Taxa for which there is no association include those with few vegetation occurrences and those for which a large proportion of the pollen appears to have been derived from outside the study areas. We conclude that modern pollen samples collected from fen carr broadly reflect the vegetation composition of the study areas. However, the input of pollen from fen carr species is spatially inconsistent. Differences between the sample points can be attributed to the distribution and pollination biology of the under-storey and ground flora elements and the structure of the vegetation around sites. The results caution against assuming that changes in the pollen representation of wetland taxa, in fossil sequences constructed from fen carr deposits, necessarily reflect changes in the overall composition of the community.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous changes in the representation of wetland and dry land taxa are a common feature of mid and late Holocene pollen diagrams from the coastal wetlands of North-West Europe. Distinguishing both the areas affected and between natural and anthropogenic causes can be problematic. High temporal resolution, improved taxonomic procedures and multivariate statistics have been applied to two Thames estuary sites, along with simulation models, to resolve these issues. Large Poaceae pollen grains appear to be derived from wild grasses rather than cereals, while modelling indicates that even extensive clearance in dry land areas produces relatively minor changes in pollen assemblages where fen carr is the in situ vegetation. It is concluded that rapid/abrupt simultaneous pollen stratigraphic events in coastal wetlands are likely to have been caused by wetland vegetation changes alone. Simultaneous events, dating from c. 2150\textendash 1300 cal a BC, can be distinguished at 12 Thames estuary pollen sites. During this interval inter-tidal environments expanded creating areas attractive to human populations for pasturage. This exploitation is likely to have led to further changes in wetland vegetation and increased clearance activity on adjacent dry land areas. In such circumstances disentangling the processes causing vegetation change is challenging, although considerably aided by the techniques adopted in this paper.

Studies of mathematical and experimental systems have shown that systems may /`wobble/' before a critical transition. Such early warning signals may be due to the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which causes a system to recover slowly from small impacts, or to a flickering phenomenon, which causes a system to switch back and forth between alternative states in response to relatively large impacts. Such signals for transitions in social-ecological systems have rarely been observed, not the least because high-resolution time series are normally required. Here we combine empirical data from a lake-catchment system with a mathematical model and show that flickering can be detected from sparse data. We show how rising variance coupled to decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started 10-30 years before the transition to eutrophic lake conditions in both the empirical records and the model output, a finding that is consistent with flickering rather than critical slowing down. Our results suggest that if environmental regimes are sufficiently affected by large external impacts that flickering is induced, then early warning signals of transitions in modern social-ecological systems may be stronger, and hence easier to identify, than previously thought.},

We use simulation to disprove both statements. * In situations where there is a shift in total abundance from one location to the next, the effects of location-dispersion confounding can be considerable. But we also show that even if there is no systematic difference in total abundance between two communities, and no change in dispersion, distance-based analysis may falsely claim that there is a change. * We agree that multivariate abundance data are hierarchical, and that it is helpful to study effects at both the species-level and the community level. However, disentangling species-level from community-level effects is not possible without a hierarchical method of analysis.

  abstract = {Fossil pollen data from sediment cores may be used as a measure for past plant diversity. According to the theory of probability, palynological richness is positively related to the pollen count. In a low pollen count, only common taxa are detected, whereas rare taxa are only detected by chance. The detection of all pollen taxa requires a very high pollen count, which is time-consuming. In regular palynological investigations, the detected richness in pollen spectra varies with the pollen count. Rarefaction analysis estimates palynological richness in an exactly equal-sum count for all samples, so that comparison between samples is meaningful. However, the over-representation of some taxa suppresses the detection probability of rare taxa; low total pollen abundance in a sample enhances the detection probability of rare taxa and long-distance transported pollen grains. These factors bias the observed palynological richness and distort comparisons. Palynological richness in a pollen count proportional to its pollen influx may be one proxy for reconstructing diversity trends through time. The use of this proxy overcomes most problems encountered in rarefaction analysis, but is constrained by inaccuracy in estimating pollen influx due to the imprecise time control of sediment cores. Estimating palynological richness by mathematical methods may be another way of reconstructing pollen diversity. Pollen data tend to reflect diversity on a regional scale. Sites from small basins have the advantage of recording diversity at both local and regional scales, if the detection of each taxon is independent. By associating one site from a large basin with a series of sites from very small basins (e.g. forest-hollows), information about both regional and local diversity may be obtained. Entomophilous pollen taxa may have to be measured using a different strategy than anemophilous taxa.},

Basic to the selection and use of reference information is the need to understand temporal and spatial variation in nature. This is a challenging task: variation is likely to be scale dependent; ecosystems vary in complex ways at several spatial and temporal scales; and there is an important interaction between spatial and temporal variation. The two most common forms of reference information are historical data from the site to be restored and contemporary data from reference sites (sites chosen as good analogs of the site to be restored). Among the problems of historical data are unmeasured factors that confound the interpretation of historical changes observed. Among the problems of individual reference sites is the difficulty of finding or proving a close match in all relevant ecological dimensions. Approximating and understanding ecological variation will require multiple sources of information. Restoration, by its inherently experimental nature, can further the understanding of the distribution, causes, and functions of nature's variation.},

  abstract = {Eutrophication is the most pressing threat to highly calcareous (marl) lakes in Europe. Despite their unique chemistry and biology, comprehensive studies into their unimpacted conditions and eutrophication responses are underrepresented in conservation literature. A multi-indicator palaeolimnological study spanning ca 1260 to 2009 was undertaken at Cunswick Tarn (UK), a small, presently eutrophic marl lake, in order to capture centennial timescales of impact. Specific aims were to 1) establish temporal patterns of change (gradual/abrupt) across biological groups, thereby testing theories of resistance of marl lake benthic communities to enrichment, and 2) compare the core record of reference condition with prevailing descriptions of high ecological status. Analyses of sediment calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), pigments, diatoms, testate amoebae, cladocerans, and macrofossils, revealed three abrupt changes in ecosystem structure. The first (1900s), with biomass increases in charophytes and other benthic nutrient-poor indicators, supported ideas of resistance to eutrophication in Chara lakes. The second transition (1930s), from charophyte to angiosperm dominance, occurred alongside reductions in macrophyte cover, increases in eutrophic indicators, and a breakdown in marling, in support of ideas of threshold responses to enrichment. Core P increased consistently into the 1990s when rapid transitions into pelagic shallow lake ecology occurred and Cunswick Tarn became biologically unidentifiable as a marl lake. The moderate total P at which these changes occurred suggests high sensitivity of marl lakes to eutrophication. Further, the early record challenges ideas of correlation between ecological condition, charophyte biomass and sediment Ca. Instead, low benthic production, macrophyte cover, and Ca sedimentation, was inferred. Management measures must focus on reducing external nutrient and sediment loads at early stages of impact in order to preserve marl lakes.},

Overhunting contributed to widespread faunal extinctions and the decline of marine megafauna, fires destroyed lowland forests, and the introduction of the omnivorous Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) led to a new wave of predation on the biota. East Polynesian islands preserve exceptionally detailed records of the initial prehistoric impacts on highly vulnerable ecosystems, but nearly all such studies are clouded by persistent controversies over the timing of initial human colonization, which has resulted in proposed settlement chronologies varying from {$\approx$}200 B.C. to 1000 A.D. or younger. Such differences underpin radically divergent interpretations of human dispersal from West Polynesia and of ecological and social transformation in East Polynesia and ultimately obfuscate the timing and patterns of this process. Using New Zealand as an example, we provide a reliable approach for accurately dating initial human colonization on Pacific islands by radiocarbon dating the arrival of the Pacific rat. Radiocarbon dates on distinctive rat-gnawed seeds and rat bones show that the Pacific rat was introduced to both main islands of New Zealand {$\approx$}1280 A.D., a millennium later than previously assumed. This matches with the earliest-dated archaeological sites, human-induced faunal extinctions, and deforestation, implying there was no long period of invisibility in either the archaeological or palaeoecological records.},

  abstract = {Islands play a key role globally in the conservation of endemic species. Many island reserves have been highly modified since human colonization, and their restoration and management usually occur without knowledge of their prehuman state. However, conservation paleoecology is increasingly being recognized as a tool that can help to inform both restoration and conservation of island reserves by providing prehuman vegetation baselines. Many of New Zealand's mammal-free offshore islands are foci for biological diversity conservation and, like many islands in the Polynesian region, were deforested following initial human settlement. Therefore, their current restoration, replanting, and management are guided either by historic vegetation descriptions or the occurrence of species on forested islands. We analyzed pollen and ancient DNA in soil cores from an offshore island in northern New Zealand. The result was a 2000-year record of vegetation change that began {$>$}1200 years before human settlement and spanned 550 years of human occupation and 180 years of forest succession since human occupation ceased. Between prehuman and contemporary forests there was nearly a complete species turnover including the extirpation of a dominant conifer and a palm tree. The podocarp-dominated forests were replaced by a native but novel angiosperm-dominated forest.

  abstract = {Islands play a key role globally in the conservation of endemic species. Many island reserves have been highly modified since human colonization, and their restoration and management usually occur without knowledge of their prehuman state. However, conservation paleoecology is increasingly being recognized as a tool that can help to inform both restoration and conservation of island reserves by providing prehuman vegetation baselines. Many of New Zealand's mammal-free offshore islands are foci for biological diversity conservation and, like many islands in the Polynesian region, were deforested following initial human settlement. Therefore, their current restoration, replanting, and management are guided either by historic vegetation descriptions or the occurrence of species on forested islands. We analyzed pollen and ancient DNA in soil cores from an offshore island in northern New Zealand. The result was a 2000-year record of vegetation change that began {$>$}1200 years before human settlement and spanned 550 years of human occupation and 180 years of forest succession since human occupation ceased. Between prehuman and contemporary forests there was nearly a complete species turnover including the extirpation of a dominant conifer and a palm tree. The podocarp-dominated forests were replaced by a native but novel angiosperm-dominated forest. There is no modern analog of the prehuman forests on any northern New Zealand island, and those islands that are forested are dominated by angiosperms which are assumed to be climax forests. The pollen and DNA evidence for conifer- and palm-rich forests in the prehuman era challenge this climax forest assumption. Prehuman vegetation records can thus help to inform future restoration of degraded offshore islands by informing the likely rate and direction of successional change; helping to determine whether natural rates of succession are preferable to more costly replanting programs; and providing past species lists if restoration replanting is desired.

This paper reviews pollen and charcoal analyses of lake and peat sediment cores from sites at various distances and directions from the Taupo vent to establish the effects of this eruption on the surrounding forests. Forests within range of the ignimbrite were destroyed, and forests located up to 170 km east of the vent suffered variable degrees of damage from ashfall. Stands of Pteridium esculentum and other seral taxa flourished immediately after the eruption. Fires occurred during the eruption and continued for several decades after. The degree and nature of vegetation disturbance above the Taupo Tephra varied according to the thickness of ashfall, local topographical features and probably the vigour of the forest. Revegetation was complete within 200 years of the eruption, even at sites overwhelmed by the Taupo Ignimbrite. Post-eruption forests were similar to those existing before the Taupo eruption.},

We used plot-based data on vegetation structure to infer potential community changes. Results: Twenty-four alliances were recognized, each of 19 to 105 plots, with estimated extents of 144 000\textendash 794 000 ha. Stand structure data suggest that 15 alliances are largely stable whereas nine may undergo compositional change. Among alliances, the proportion of exotic species ranged from 0 to 50\%. Our forest and shrubland classification is another stage in progressively revising such classifications (i.e. forest class maps, vegetative cover map, ECOSAT woody classification and land cover database) produced over the last five decades. Conclusions: Compared to the previous classifications, our new classification incorporates alliances in disturbed landscapes, as well as those that are compositionally dynamic and which are also invaded by exotic species. It also provides greater partitioning within Nothofagus forests, but fails to distinguish some rare forest types, such as those dominated by Agathis australis. Our classification can contribute to a framework for national reporting of ecological indicators and management of woody vegetation.},

  abstract = {The stratigraphic relationships of palaeoecological proxies and use of changepoint analyses to determine the cause and effect relationships between past events has allowed a better understanding of the relative contributions of humans and environmental drivers to Late Quaternary extinctions and of their effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies, however, have validated these approaches at localities where past interactions between vegetation communities and large herbivores are well-documented. Here, we use a peat core from subantarctic Enderby Island to present the first study tracing the spores of dung fungi alongside pollen at a site where the history of mammalian herbivore introductions (and subsequent eradication), and their effects on the vegetation, are precisely known. We find a strong connection between spore influx rates of the dung-fungus Sporormiella and PCA axis 1 of the pollen assemblages, suggesting that past vegetation change caused by herbivore introductions and eradications at the core site can be readily deduced from the palaeoecological record. The response of the vegetation community to the removal of herbivores was so rapid, however, that a difference in timing between changepoints relating to specific pollen taxa, the overall pollen community, and the decline of Sporormiella spores, could not be resolved in our record, despite a sampling resolution of {$<$}5 years. We suggest that further case-studies, spanning different vegetation and herbivore communities, are required to provide increased confidence in inferences drawn about cause-and-effect relationships using proxy changepoint offsets in palaeoecological records.},

The forest plot bearing the maximum pollen-vegetation correlation (MPVC) for all taxa was found to be 60\textendash 100 m long. The MPVC plots for 10 individual taxa differed predictably according to pollen transportability, which shows the significance of wind dispersion even under the dense canopy. Big and/or poorly dispersed pollen types (Parrotia, Zelkova, Diospyros, Acer) had a MPVC plot about 20 m long while, for the better dispersed pollen of Alnus, Quercus, Fraxinus, Carpinus MPVC plot size ranged between 100 and 220 m long. The spatial pattern of tree population as well as the pollination strategy also affects the MPVC area. Alnus grows patchily along the streams and its pollen appears to be less transportable when compared with the more smoothly distributed Carpinus. Insectpollinated Acer has relatively small but poorly dispersed pollen. The montane relief may, presumably, also control pollen dispersion and representation.},

I also use documented trends in population, land use, and biodiversity awareness to suggest that in the future ecological restoration will play an increasing role in biodiversity conservation. The conservation mind set is one of loss on a relatively short time horizon, whereas the restoration mind set is one of long-term recovery. I suggest that a restoration mind set can provide useful insights into problems of conservation today, illustrated with examples examining edge effects and integrated conservation and development projects.},

Furthermore, many wetland invaders form monotypes, which alter habitat structure, lower biodiversity (both number and ``quality'' of species), change nutrient cycling and productivity (often increasing it), and modify food webs. Wetlands are landscape sinks, which accumulate debris, sediments, water, and nutrients, all of which facilitate invasions by creating canopy gaps or accelerating the growth of opportunistic plant species. These and other disturbances to wetlands, such as propagule influx, salt influx, and hydroperiod alteration, create opportunities that are well matched by wetland opportunists. No single hypothesis or plant attribute explains all wetland invasions, but the propensity for wetlands to become dominated by invasive monotypes is arguably an effect of the cumulative impacts associated with landscape sinks, including import of hydrophytes that exhibit efficient growth (high plant volume per unit biomass).},

Because most nations lack wetland inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining wetlands occupy less than 9\% of the earth's land area, they contribute more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area implies. Biodiversity support, water quality improvement, flood abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives. Not all damages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear how much can be retained through restoration. Hence, we recommend adaptive approaches in which alternative techniques are tested at large scales in actual restoration sites.},
