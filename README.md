# baselines-supplement
The repository for the technical supplement from our Holocene paper. Placed on github for the likely day the package and supplement will be updated using the `sf` package. With thanks to Anna Chagas for comments on the supplement!

Note: you probably only want the pdf!! The RMD is included here but requires extra packages to build the pdf and arrange the figures.
